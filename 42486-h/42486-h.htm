<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>THE TURN OF THE SCREW</h2>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently
breathless, but except the obvious remark
that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas eve in an
old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I
remember no comment uttered till somebody happened
to say that it was the only case he had met
in which such a visitation had fallen on a child.
The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition
in just such an old house as had gathered us for
the occasion&mdash;an appearance, of a dreadful kind,
to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother
and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her
not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep
again, but to encounter also, herself, before she
had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had
shaken him. It was this observation that drew
from Douglas&mdash;not immediately, but later in the
evening&mdash;a reply that had the interesting consequence
to which I call attention. Someone else
told a story not particularly effective, which I saw
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
he was not following. This I took for a sign that
he had himself something to produce and that we
should only have to wait. We waited in fact till
two nights later; but that same evening, before
we scattered, he brought out what was in his
mind.</p>

<p>“I quite agree&mdash;in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or
whatever it was&mdash;that its appearing first to the
little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular
touch. But it’s not the first occurrence of its
charming kind that I know to have involved a
child. If the child gives the effect another turn of
the screw, what do you say to <em>two</em> children<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“We say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that
they give two turns! Also that we want to hear
about them.”</p>

<p>I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which
he had got up to present his back, looking down
at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets.
“Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It’s
quite too horrible.” This, naturally, was declared
by several voices to give the thing the utmost
price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his
triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us
and going on: “It’s beyond everything. Nothing
at all that I know touches it.”</p>

<p>“For sheer terror?” I remember asking.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>He seemed to say it was not so simple as that;
to be really at a loss how to qualify it. He
passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing
grimace. “For dreadful&mdash;dreadfulness!”</p>

<p>“Oh, how delicious!” cried one of the women.</p>

<p>He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but
as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
“For general uncanny ugliness and horror and
pain.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” I said, “just sit right down and
begin.”</p>

<p>He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a
log, watched it an instant. Then as he faced us
again: “I can’t begin. I shall have to send to
town.” There was a unanimous groan at this,
and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied
way, he explained. “The story’s
written. It’s in a locked drawer&mdash;it has not
been out for years. I could write to my man and
enclose the key; he could send down the packet
as he finds it.” It was to me in particular that
he appeared to propound this&mdash;appeared almost
to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken
a thickness of ice, the formation of many a
winter; had had his reasons for a long silence.
The others resented postponement, but it was
just his scruples that charmed me. I adjured
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
him to write by the first post and to agree with
us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the
experience in question had been his own. To
this his answer was prompt. “Oh, thank God,
no!”</p>

<p>“And is the record yours? You took the
thing down?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but the impression. I took that
<em>here</em>”&mdash;he tapped his heart. “I’ve never lost it.”</p>

<p>“Then your manuscript<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful
hand.” He hung fire again. “A woman’s.
She has been dead these twenty years. She
sent me the pages in question before she died.”
They were all listening now, and of course there
was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw
the inference. But if he put the inference by
without a smile it was also without irritation.
“She was a most charming person, but she was
ten years older than I. She was my sister’s
governess,” he quietly said. “She was the most
agreeable woman I’ve ever known in her position;
she would have been worthy of any whatever.
It was long ago, and this episode was long
before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at
home on my coming down the second summer.
I was much there that year&mdash;it was a beautiful
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls
and talks in the garden&mdash;talks in which she
struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes;
don’t grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to
this day to think she liked me too. If she hadn’t
she wouldn’t have told me. She had never told
anyone. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but
that I knew she hadn’t. I was sure; I could see.
You’ll easily judge why when you hear.”</p>

<p>“Because the thing had been such a scare?”</p>

<p>He continued to fix me. “You’ll easily judge,”
he repeated: “<em>you</em> will.”</p>

<p>I fixed him too. “I see. She was in love.”</p>

<p>He laughed for the first time. “You <em>are</em> acute.
Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been.
That came out&mdash;she couldn’t tell her story without
its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw
it; but neither of us spoke of it. I remember
the time and the place&mdash;the corner of the lawn,
the shade of the great beeches and the long,
hot summer afternoon. It wasn’t a scene for a
shudder; but oh<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” He quitted the fire
and dropped back into his chair.</p>

<p>“You’ll receive the packet Thursday morning?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“Probably not till the second post.”</p>

<p>“Well then; after dinner<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>“You’ll all meet me here?” He looked us
round again. “Isn’t anybody going?” It was
almost the tone of hope.</p>

<p>“Everybody will stay!”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> will&mdash;and <em>I</em> will!” cried the ladies whose
departure had been fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however,
expressed the need for a little more light.
“Who was it she was in love with?”</p>

<p>“The story will tell,” I took upon myself to
reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!”</p>

<p>“The story <em>won’t</em> tell,” said Douglas; “not in
any literal, vulgar way.”</p>

<p>“More’s the pity, then. That’s the only way I
ever understand.”</p>

<p>“Won’t <em>you</em> tell, Douglas?” somebody else inquired.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet again. “Yes&mdash;tomorrow.
Now I must go to bed. Good-night.”
And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left
us slightly bewildered. From our end of the
great brown hall we heard his step on the stair;
whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. “Well, if I don’t
know who she was in love with, I know who <em>he</em> was.”</p>

<p>“She was ten years older,” said her husband.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raison de plus</i>&mdash;at that age! But it’s rather
nice, his long reticence.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>“Forty years!” Griffin put in.</p>

<p>“With this outbreak at last.”</p>

<p>“The outbreak,” I returned, “will make a
tremendous occasion of Thursday night;” and
everyone so agreed with me that, in the light
of it, we lost all attention for everything else.
The last story, however incomplete and like the
mere opening of a serial, had been told; we
handshook and “candlestuck,” as somebody said,
and went to bed.</p>

<p>I knew the next day that a letter containing
the key had, by the first post, gone off to his
London apartments; but in spite of&mdash;or perhaps
just on account of&mdash;the eventual diffusion of
this knowledge we quite let him alone till after
dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in fact,
as might best accord with the kind of emotion
on which our hopes were fixed. Then he became
as communicative as we could desire and indeed
gave us his best reason for being so. We had it
from him again before the fire in the hall, as we
had had our mild wonders of the previous night.
It appeared that the narrative he had promised
to read us really required for a proper intelligence
a few words of prologue. Let me say here
distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative,
from an exact transcript of my own made
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor
Douglas, before his death&mdash;when it was in sight&mdash;committed
to me the manuscript that reached
him on the third of these days and that, on the
same spot, with immense effect, he began to read
to our hushed little circle on the night of the
fourth. The departing ladies who had said they
would stay didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay:
they departed, in consequence of arrangements
made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed,
produced by the touches with which he had
already worked us up. But that only made his
little final auditory more compact and select, kept
it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.</p>

<p>The first of these touches conveyed that the
written statement took up the tale at a point
after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to
be in possession of was therefore that his old
friend, the youngest of several daughters of a
poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty,
on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom,
come up to London, in trepidation, to answer
in person an advertisement that had already
placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser.
This person proved, on her presenting
herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley
Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing&mdash;this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
prospective patron proved a gentleman, a
bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as
had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel,
before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire
vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it
never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and
bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind.
He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid,
but what took her most of all and gave her the
courage she afterwards showed was that he put
the whole thing to her as a kind of favour, an
obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived
him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant&mdash;saw
him all in a glow of high fashion, of good
looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with
women. He had for his own town residence a
big house filled with the spoils of travel and the
trophies of the chase; but it was to his country
home, an old family place in Essex, that he
wished her immediately to proceed.</p>

<p>He had been left, by the death of their parents
in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small
niece, children of a younger, a military brother,
whom he had lost two years before. These
children were, by the strangest of chances for a
man in his position,&mdash;a lone man without the
right sort of experience or a grain of patience,&mdash;very
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
heavily on his hands. It had all been a
great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a
series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the
poor chicks and had done all he could; had in
particular sent them down to his other house, the
proper place for them being of course the country,
and kept them there, from the first, with the best
people he could find to look after them, parting
even with his own servants to wait on them and
going down himself, whenever he might, to see
how they were doing. The awkward thing was
that they had practically no other relations and
that his own affairs took up all his time. He had
put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy
and secure, and had placed at the head of their
little establishment&mdash;but below stairs only&mdash;an
excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure
his visitor would like and who had formerly been
maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper
and was also acting for the time as superintendent
to the little girl, of whom, without children of her
own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond.
There were plenty of people to help, but of course
the young lady who should go down as governess
would be in supreme authority. She would also
have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who
had been for a term at school&mdash;young as he was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
to be sent, but what else could be done?&mdash;and
who, as the holidays were about to begin, would
be back from one day to the other. There had
been for the two children at first a young lady
whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She
had done for them quite beautifully&mdash;she was a
most respectable person&mdash;till her death, the great
awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative
but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose,
since then, in the way of manners and things, had
done as she could for Flora; and there were,
further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an
old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all
likewise thoroughly respectable.</p>

<p>So far had Douglas presented his picture when
someone put a question. “And what did the
former governess die of?&mdash;of so much respectability?”</p>

<p>Our friend’s answer was prompt. “That will
come out. I don’t anticipate.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me&mdash;I thought that was just what
you <em>are</em> doing.”</p>

<p>“In her successor’s place,” I suggested, “I
should have wished to learn if the office brought
with it<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Necessary danger to life?” Douglas completed
my thought. “She did wish to learn, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow what
she learnt. Meanwhile, of course, the prospect
struck her as slightly grim. She was young, untried,
nervous: it was a vision of serious duties
and little company, of really great loneliness.
She hesitated&mdash;took a couple of days to consult
and consider. But the salary offered much
exceeded her modest measure, and on a second
interview she faced the music, she engaged.” And
Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the
benefit of the company, moved me to throw in&mdash;</p>

<p>“The moral of which was of course the seduction
exercised by the splendid young man. She
succumbed to it.”</p>

<p>He got up and, as he had done the night before,
went to the fire, gave a stir to a log with his foot,
then stood a moment with his back to us. “She
saw him only twice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.”</p>

<p>A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned
round to me. “It <em>was</em> the beauty of it. There
were others,” he went on, “who hadn’t succumbed.
He told her frankly all his difficulty&mdash;that
for several applicants the conditions had
been prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply
afraid. It sounded dull&mdash;it sounded strange; and
all the more so because of his main condition.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>“Which was<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“That she should never trouble him&mdash;but
never, never: neither appeal nor complain nor
write about anything; only meet all questions
herself, receive all moneys from his solicitor, take
the whole thing over and let him alone. She
promised to do this, and she mentioned to me
that when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted,
he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice,
she already felt rewarded.”</p>

<p>“But was that all her reward?” one of the
ladies asked.</p>

<p>“She never saw him again.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the lady; which, as our friend
immediately left us again, was the only other
word of importance contributed to the subject
till, the next night, by the corner of the hearth,
in the best chair, he opened the faded red cover
of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. The
whole thing took indeed more nights than one,
but on the first occasion the same lady put another
question. “What is your title?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>I</em> have!” I said. But Douglas, without
heeding me, had begun to read with a fine clearness
that was like a rendering to the ear of the
beauty of his author’s hand.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>I</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">I remember</span> the whole beginning as a succession
of flights and drops, a little see-saw of the
right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in
town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a
couple of very bad days&mdash;found myself doubtful
again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake.
In this state of mind I spent the long hours of
bumping, swinging coach that carried me to the
stopping-place at which I was to be met by a
vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was
told, had been ordered, and I found, toward the
close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in
waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a
lovely day, through a country to which the summer
sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome,
my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we
turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve
that was probably but a proof of the point to
which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected,
or had dreaded, something so melancholy that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember
as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear
front, its open windows and fresh curtains and
the pair of maids looking out; I remember the
lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of
my wheels on the gravel and the clustered treetops
over which the rooks circled and cawed in
the golden sky. The scene had a greatness
that made it a different affair from my own
scant home, and there immediately appeared at
the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil
person who dropped me as decent a curtsey as
if I had been the mistress or a distinguished
visitor. I had received in Harley Street a
narrower notion of the place, and that, as I
recalled it, made me think the proprietor still
more of a gentleman, suggested that what I
was to enjoy might be something beyond his
promise.</p>

<p>I had no drop again till the next day, for I
was carried triumphantly through the following
hours by my introduction to the younger of my
pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs.
Grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so
charming as to make it a great fortune to have
to do with her. She was the most beautiful
child I had ever seen, and I afterwards wondered
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
that my employer had not told me more
of her. I slept little that night&mdash;I was too
much excited; and this astonished me too, I
recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense
of the liberality with which I was treated. The
large, impressive room, one of the best in the
house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it,
the full, figured draperies, the long glasses in
which, for the first time, I could see myself
from head to foot, all struck me&mdash;like the extraordinary
charm of my small charge&mdash;as so
many things thrown in. It was thrown in as
well, from the first moment, that I should get
on with Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on
my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather
brooded. The only thing indeed that in this
early outlook might have made me shrink again
was the clear circumstance of her being so glad
to see me. I perceived within half an hour
that she was so glad&mdash;stout, simple, plain,
clean, wholesome woman&mdash;as to be positively
on her guard against showing it too much. I
wondered even then a little why she should
wish not to show it, and that, with reflection,
with suspicion, might of course have made me
uneasy.</p>

<p>But it was a comfort that there could be no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
uneasiness in a connection with anything so
beatific as the radiant image of my little girl,
the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably
more than anything else to do with the
restlessness that, before morning, made me several
times rise and wander about my room to
take in the whole picture and prospect; to
watch, from my open window, the faint summer
dawn, to look at such portions of the rest of
the house as I could catch, and to listen, while,
in the fading dusk, the first birds began to
twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound
or two, less natural and not without, but within,
that I had fancied I heard. There had been a
moment when I believed I recognised, faint and
far, the cry of a child; there had been another
when I found myself just consciously starting
as at the passage, before my door, of a light
footstep. But these fancies were not marked
enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in
the light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of
other and subsequent matters that they now
come back to me. To watch, teach, “form”
little Flora would too evidently be the making
of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed
between us downstairs that after this first occasion
I should have her as a matter of course at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
night, her small white bed being already arranged,
to that end, in my room. What I had
undertaken was the whole care of her, and she
had remained, just this last time, with Mrs.
Grose only as an effect of our consideration for
my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity.
In spite of this timidity&mdash;which the child
herself, in the oddest way in the world, had
been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing
it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness,
with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of
one of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed,
to be imputed to her and to determine us&mdash;I
felt quite sure she would presently like me.
It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose
herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in
my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper
with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a
high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between
them, over bread and milk. There were
naturally things that in Flora’s presence could
pass between us only as prodigious and gratified
looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.</p>

<p>“And the little boy&mdash;does he look like her?
Is he too so very remarkable?”</p>

<p>One wouldn’t flatter a child. “Oh, Miss, <em>most</em>
remarkable. If you think well of this one!”&mdash;and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
she stood there with a plate in her hand,
beaming at our companion, who looked from one
of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that
contained nothing to check us.</p>

<p>“Yes; if I do<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“You <em>will</em> be carried away by the little gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Well, that, I think, is what I came for&mdash;to
be carried away. I’m afraid, however,” I remember
feeling the impulse to add, “I’m rather easily
carried away. I was carried away in London!”</p>

<p>I can still see Mrs. Grose’s broad face as she
took this in. “In Harley Street?”</p>

<p>“In Harley Street.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss, you’re not the first&mdash;and you
won’t be the last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve no pretension,” I could laugh, “to
being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate,
as I understand, comes back tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Not tomorrow&mdash;Friday, Miss. He arrives,
as you did, by the coach, under care of the guard,
and is to be met by the same carriage.”</p>

<p>I forthwith expressed that the proper as well
as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore
that on the arrival of the public conveyance
I should be in waiting for him with his little
sister; an idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
so heartily that I somehow took her manner as
a kind of comforting pledge&mdash;never falsified,
thank heaven!&mdash;that we should on every question
be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I was
there!</p>

<p>What I felt the next day was, I suppose,
nothing that could be fairly called a reaction
from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably
at the most only a slight oppression produced
by a fuller measure of the scale, as I walked
round them, gazed up at them, took them in,
of my new circumstances. They had, as it were,
an extent and mass for which I had not been
prepared and in the presence of which I found
myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little
proud. Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered
some delay; I reflected that my first duty
was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win
the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent
the day with her out of doors; I arranged with
her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be
she, she only, who might show me the place.
She showed it step by step and room by room
and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish
talk about it and with the result, in half an
hour, of our becoming immense friends. Young
as she was, I was struck, throughout our little
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
tour, with her confidence and courage with the
way, in empty chambers and dull corridors, on
crooked staircases that made me pause and even
on the summit of an old machicolated square
tower that made me dizzy, her morning music,
her disposition to tell me so many more things
than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have
not seen Bly since the day I left it, and I dare
say that to my older and more informed eyes it
would now appear sufficiently contracted. But
as my little conductress, with her hair of gold
and her frock of blue, danced before me round
corners and pattered down passages, I had the
view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy
sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion
of the young idea, take all colour out
of storybooks and fairy-tales. Wasn’t it just
a storybook over which I had fallen a-doze and
a-dream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but
convenient house, embodying a few features of
a building still older, half replaced and half utilised,
in which I had the fancy of our being
almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a
great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at
the helm!</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>II</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">This</span> came home to me when, two days later,
I drove over with Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose
said, the little gentleman; and all the more for
an incident that, presenting itself the second
evening, had deeply disconcerted me. The first
day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed,
reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen
apprehension. The postbag, that evening,&mdash;it
came late,&mdash;contained a letter for me, which,
however, in the hand of my employer, I found
to be composed but of a few words enclosing
another, addressed to himself, with a seal still
unbroken. “This, I recognise, is from the head-master,
and the head-master’s an awful bore.
Read him, please; deal with him; but mind
you don’t report. Not a word. I’m off!” I
broke the seal with a great effort&mdash;so great
a one that I was a long time coming to it; took
the unopened missive at last up to my room and
only attacked it just before going to bed. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
had better have let it wait till morning, for it
gave me a second sleepless night. With no
counsel to take, the next day, I was full of distress;
and it finally got so the better of me that
I determined to open myself at least to Mrs.
Grose.</p>

<p>“What does it mean? The child’s dismissed
his school.”</p>

<p>She gave me a look that I remarked at the
moment; then, visibly, with a quick blankness,
seemed to try to take it back. “But aren’t they
all<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Sent home&mdash;yes. But only for the holidays.
Miles may never go back at all.”</p>

<p>Consciously, under my attention, she reddened.
“They won’t take him?”</p>

<p>“They absolutely decline.”</p>

<p>At this she raised her eyes, which she had
turned from me; I saw them fill with good tears.
“What has he done?”</p>

<p>I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand
her my letter&mdash;which, however, had the effect
of making her, without taking it, simply put her
hands behind her. She shook her head sadly.
“Such things are not for me, Miss.”</p>

<p>My counsellor couldn’t read! I winced at my
mistake, which I attenuated as I could, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then,
faltering in the act and folding it up once more,
I put it back in my pocket. “Is he really <em>bad</em>?”</p>

<p>The tears were still in her eyes. “Do the gentlemen
say so?”</p>

<p>“They go into no particulars. They simply
express their regret that it should be impossible
to keep him. That can have only one meaning.”
Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she
forbore to ask me what this meaning might be;
so that, presently, to put the thing with some
coherence and with the mere aid of her presence
to my own mind, I went on: “That he’s an
injury to the others.”</p>

<p>At this, with one of the quick turns of simple
folk, she suddenly flamed up. “Master Miles!
<em>him</em> an injury?”</p>

<p>There was such a flood of good faith in it that,
though I had not yet seen the child, my very
fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea.
I found myself, to meet my friend the better,
offering it, on the spot, sarcastically. “To his
poor little innocent mates!”</p>

<p>“It’s too dreadful,” cried Mrs. Grose, “to say
such cruel things! Why, he’s scarce ten years
old.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; it would be incredible.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>She was evidently grateful for such a profession.
“See him, Miss, first. <em>Then</em> believe it!”
I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him;
it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all
the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain.
Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what
she had produced in me, and she followed it up
with assurance. “You might as well believe it
of the little lady. Bless her,” she added the
next moment&mdash;“<em>look</em> at her!”</p>

<p>I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes
before, I had established in the schoolroom
with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy
of nice “round O’s,” now presented herself to
view at the open door. She expressed in her
little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable
duties, looking to me, however, with a
great childish light that seemed to offer it as a
mere result of the affection she had conceived
for my person, which had rendered necessary
that she should follow me. I needed nothing
more than this to feel the full force of Mrs.
Grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in
my arms, covered her with kisses in which there
was a sob of atonement.</p>

<p>None the less, the rest of the day, I watched
for further occasion to approach my colleague,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy
she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her,
I remember, on the staircase; we went down
together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding
her there with a hand on her arm. “I take
what you said to me at noon as a declaration
that <em>you’ve</em> never known him to be bad.”</p>

<p>She threw back her head; she had clearly, by
this time, and very honestly, adopted an attitude.
“Oh, never known him&mdash;I don’t pretend <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>I was upset again. “Then you <em>have</em> known
him<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed, Miss, thank God!”</p>

<p>On reflection I accepted this. “You mean that
a boy who never is<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Is no boy for <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>I held her tighter. “You like them with the
spirit to be naughty?” Then, keeping pace with
her answer, “So do I!” I eagerly brought out.
“But not to the degree to contaminate<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“To contaminate?”&mdash;my big word left her at
a loss. I explained it. “To corrupt.”</p>

<p>She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced
in her an odd laugh. “Are you afraid
he’ll corrupt <em>you</em>?” She put the question with
such a fine bold humour that, with a laugh, a
little silly doubtless, to match her own, I gave
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.</p>

<p>But the next day, as the hour for my drive
approached, I cropped up in another place.
“What was the lady who was here before?”</p>

<p>“The last governess? She was also young
and pretty&mdash;almost as young and almost as
pretty, Miss, even as you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty
helped her!” I recollect throwing off. “He
seems to like us young and pretty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he <em>did</em>,” Mrs. Grose assented: “it was
the way he liked everyone!” She had no sooner
spoken indeed than she caught herself up. “I
mean that’s <em>his</em> way&mdash;the master’s.”</p>

<p>I was struck. “But of whom did you speak
first?”</p>

<p>She looked blank, but she coloured. “Why,
of <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>“Of the master?”</p>

<p>“Of who else?”</p>

<p>There was so obviously no one else that the
next moment I had lost my impression of her
having accidentally said more than she meant;
and I merely asked what I wanted to know.
“Did <em>she</em> see anything in the boy<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t right? She never told me.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>I had a scruple, but I overcame it. “Was
she careful&mdash;particular?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious.
“About some things&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“But not about all?”</p>

<p>Again she considered. “Well, Miss&mdash;she’s
gone. I won’t tell tales.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand your feeling,” I hastened
to reply; but I thought it, after an instant, not
opposed to this concession to pursue: “Did she
die here?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;she went off.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what there was in this brevity
of Mrs. Grose’s that struck me as ambiguous.
“Went off to die?” Mrs. Grose looked straight
out of the window, but I felt that, hypothetically,
I had a right to know what young persons engaged
for Bly were expected to do. “She was taken ill,
you mean, and went home?”</p>

<p>“She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in
this house. She left it, at the end of the year, to
go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which
the time she had put in had certainly given her a
right. We had then a young woman&mdash;a nursemaid
who had stayed on and who was a good girl
and clever; and <em>she</em> took the children altogether
for the interval. But our young lady never came
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
back, and at the very moment I was expecting her
I heard from the master that she was dead.”</p>

<p>I turned this over. “But of what?”</p>

<p>“He never told me! But please, Miss,” said
Mrs. Grose, “I must get to my work.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>III</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">Her</span> thus turning her back on me was fortunately
not, for my just preoccupations, a snub that
could check the growth of our mutual esteem.
We met, after I had brought home little Miles,
more intimately than ever on the ground of my
stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous
was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child
as had now been revealed to me should be under
an interdict. I was a little late on the scene, and
I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me
before the door of the inn at which the coach had
put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant,
without and within, in the great glow of freshness,
the same positive fragrance of purity, in
which I had, from the first moment, seen his little
sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs.
Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a
sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept
away by his presence. What I then and there
took him to my heart for was something divine
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
that I have never found to the same degree in
any child&mdash;his indescribable little air of knowing
nothing in the world but love. It would have
been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater
sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got
back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered&mdash;so
far, that is, as I was not outraged&mdash;by
the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my
room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a
private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her
that it was grotesque.</p>

<p>She promptly understood me. “You mean the
cruel charge<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t live an instant. My dear woman,
<em>look</em> at him!”</p>

<p>She smiled at my pretension to have discovered
his charm. “I assure you, Miss, I do nothing
else! What will you say, then?” she immediately
added.</p>

<p>“In answer to the letter?” I had made up
my mind. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>“And to his uncle?”</p>

<p>I was incisive. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>“And to the boy himself?”</p>

<p>I was wonderful. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>She gave with her apron a great wipe to her
mouth. “Then I’ll stand by you. We’ll see it out.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>“We’ll see it out!” I ardently echoed, giving
her my hand to make it a vow.</p>

<p>She held me there a moment, then whisked up
her apron again with her detached hand. “Would
you mind, Miss, if I used the freedom<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“To kiss me? No!” I took the good creature
in my arms and, after we had embraced like
sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.</p>

<p>This, at all events, was for the time: a time so
full that, as I recall the way it went, it reminds
me of all the art I now need to make it a little
distinct. What I look back at with amazement
is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken,
with my companion, to see it out, and I was under
a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the
extent and the far and difficult connections of
such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave
of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my
ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit,
to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education
for the world was all on the point of beginning.
I am unable even to remember at this day
what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays
and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with
me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a
theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for
weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
I learnt something&mdash;at first certainly&mdash;that had
not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered
life; learnt to be amused, and even amusing,
and not to think for the morrow. It was the first
time, in a manner, that I had known space and air
and freedom, all the music of summer and all the
mystery of nature. And then there was consideration&mdash;and
consideration was sweet. Oh, it
was a trap&mdash;not designed, but deep&mdash;to my
imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity;
to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The
best way to picture it all is to say that I was off
my guard. They gave me so little trouble&mdash;they
were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to
speculate&mdash;but even this with a dim disconnectedness&mdash;as
to how the rough future (for all futures
are rough!) would handle them and might
bruise them. They had the bloom of health and
happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of
a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood,
for whom everything, to be right, would have to
be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in
my fancy, the after-years could take for them was
that of a romantic, a really royal extension of
the garden and the park. It may be, of course,
above all, that what suddenly broke into this
gives the previous time a charm of stillness&mdash;that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
hush in which something gathers or crouches.
The change was actually like the spring of a
beast.</p>

<p>In the first weeks the days were long; they
often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call
my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, tea-time
and bed-time having come and gone, I had,
before my final retirement, a small interval alone.
Much as I liked my companions, this hour was
the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked
it best of all when, as the light faded&mdash;or
rather, I should say, the day lingered and the
last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed
sky, from the old trees&mdash;I could take a turn
into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a sense
of property that amused and flattered me, the
beauty and dignity of the place. It was a
pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil
and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to
reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good
sense and general high propriety, I was giving
pleasure&mdash;if he ever thought of it!&mdash;to the
person to whose pressure I had responded.
What I was doing was what he had earnestly
hoped and directly asked of me, and that I
<em>could</em>, after all, do it proved even a greater joy
than I had expected. I dare say I fancied
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
myself, in short, a remarkable young woman
and took comfort in the faith that this would
more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable
to offer a front to the remarkable
things that presently gave their first sign.</p>

<p>It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of
my very hour: the children were tucked away
and I had come out for my stroll. One of the
thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink
now from noting, used to be with me in these
wanderings was that it would be as charming
as a charming story suddenly to meet someone.
Someone would appear there at the turn of a
path and would stand before me and smile and
approve. I didn’t ask more than that&mdash;I only
asked that he should <em>know</em>; and the only way
to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the
kind light of it, in his handsome face. That
was exactly present to me&mdash;by which I mean
the face was&mdash;when, on the first of these occasions,
at the end of a long June day, I stopped
short on emerging from one of the plantations
and coming into view of the house. What arrested
me on the spot&mdash;and with a shock much
greater than any vision had allowed for&mdash;was
the sense that my imagination had, in a flash,
turned real. He did stand there!&mdash;but high
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the
tower to which, on that first morning, little
Flora had conducted me. This tower was one
of a pair&mdash;square, incongruous, crenelated structures&mdash;that
were distinguished, for some reason,
though I could see little difference, as the new
and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the
house and were probably architectural absurdities,
redeemed in a measure indeed by not being
wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious,
dating, in their gingerbread antiquity,
from a romantic revival that was already a respectable
past. I admired them, had fancies
about them, for we could all profit in a degree,
especially when they loomed through the dusk,
by the grandeur of their actual battlements;
yet it was not at such an elevation that the
figure I had so often invoked seemed most in
place.</p>

<p>It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight,
I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion,
which were, sharply, the shock of my first and
that of my second surprise. My second was a
violent perception of the mistake of my first: the
man who met my eyes was not the person I had
precipitately supposed. There came to me thus
a bewilderment of vision of which, after these
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
years, there is no living view that I can hope to
give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a
permitted object of fear to a young woman privately
bred; and the figure that faced me was&mdash;a
few more seconds assured me&mdash;as little anyone
else I knew as it was the image that had been
in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street&mdash;I
had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover,
in the strangest way in the world, had, on
the instant, and by the very fact of its appearance,
become a solitude. To me at least, making
my statement here with a deliberation with which
I have never made it, the whole feeling of the
moment returns. It was as if, while I took in&mdash;what
I did take in&mdash;all the rest of the scene had
been stricken with death. I can hear again, as I
write, the intense hush in which the sounds of
evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in
the golden sky and the friendly hour lost, for the
minute, all its voice. But there was no other
change in nature, unless indeed it were a change
that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold
was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and
the man who looked at me over the battlements
was as definite as a picture in a frame. That’s
how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of
each person that he might have been and that he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
was not. We were confronted across our distance
quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity
who then he was and to feel, as an effect
of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few
instants more became intense.</p>

<p>The great question, or one of these, is, afterwards,
I know, with regard to certain <ins title="matters.">matters,</ins>
the question of how long they have lasted. Well,
this matter of mine, think what you will of it,
lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none
of which made a difference for the better, that I
could see, in there having been in the house&mdash;and
for how long, above all?&mdash;a person of whom
I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled
a little with the sense that my office demanded
that there should be no such ignorance and no
such person. It lasted while this visitant, at all
events,&mdash;and there was a touch of the strange
freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity
of his wearing no hat,&mdash;seemed to fix me,
from his position, with just the question, just the
scrutiny through the fading light, that his own
presence provoked. We were too far apart to
call to each other, but there was a moment at
which, at shorter range, some challenge between
us, breaking the hush, would have been the right
result of our straight mutual stare. He was in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
one of the angles, the one away from the house,
very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands
on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I
form on this page; then, exactly, after a minute,
as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly changed
his place&mdash;passed, looking at me hard all the
while, to the opposite corner of the platform.
Yes, I had the sharpest sense that during this
transit he never took his eyes from me, and I can
see at this moment the way his hand, as he went,
passed from one of the crenelations to the next.
He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and
even as he turned away still markedly fixed me.
He turned away; that was all I knew.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">It</span> was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion,
for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was
shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly&mdash;a mystery
of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable
relative kept in unsuspected confinement? I
can’t say how long I turned it over, or how
long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I
remained where I had had my collision; I only
recall that when I re-entered the house darkness
had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval,
certainly had held me and driven me, for I must,
in circling about the place, have walked three
miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more
overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was
a comparatively human chill. The most singular
part of it in fact&mdash;singular as the rest had
been&mdash;was the part I became, in the hall, aware
of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes
back to me in the general train&mdash;the impression,
as I received it on my return, of the wide white
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with
its portraits and red carpet, and of the good
surprised look of my friend, which immediately
told me she had missed me. It came to me
straightway, under her contact, that, with plain
heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance,
she knew nothing whatever that could bear
upon the incident I had there ready for her. I
had not suspected in advance that her comfortable
face would pull me up, and I somehow
measured the importance of what I had seen by
my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it.
Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me
so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear
was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing
my companion. On the spot, accordingly, in
the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I,
for a reason that I couldn’t then have phrased,
achieved an inward revolution&mdash;offered a vague
pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the
beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and
wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.</p>

<p>Here it was another affair; here, for many
days after, it was a queer affair enough. There
were hours, from day to day,&mdash;or at least there
were moments, snatched even from clear duties,&mdash;when
I had to shut myself up to think. It
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
was not so much yet that I was more nervous
than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably
afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now
to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth
that I could arrive at no account whatever of the
visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and
yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned.
It took little time to see that I could sound without
forms of inquiry and without exciting remark
any domestic complication. The shock I had
suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I
felt sure, at the end of three days and as the
result of mere closer attention, that I had not
been practised upon by the servants nor made the
object of any “game.” Of whatever it was that
I knew nothing was known around me. There
was but one sane inference: someone had taken
a liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly,
I dipped into my room and locked the
door to say to myself. We had been, collectively,
subject to an intrusion; some unscrupulous
traveller, curious in old houses, had made
his way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from
the best point of view, and then stolen out as
he came. If he had given me such a bold hard
stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion.
The good thing, after all, was that we should
surely see no more of him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not
to leave me to judge that what, essentially, made
nothing else much signify was simply my charming
work. My charming work was just my life
with Miles and Flora, and through nothing could
I so like it as through feeling that I could throw
myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my
small charges was a constant joy, leading me to
wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears,
the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the
probable grey prose of my office. There was to
be no grey prose, it appeared, and no long grind;
so how could work not be charming that presented
itself as daily beauty? It was all the
romance of the nursery and the poetry of the
schoolroom. I don’t mean by this, of course,
that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I
can express no otherwise the sort of interest my
companions inspired. How can I describe that
except by saying that instead of growing used to
them&mdash;and it’s a marvel for a governess: I
call the sisterhood to witness!&mdash;I made constant
fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly,
in which these discoveries stopped: deep
obscurity continued to cover the region of the
boy’s conduct at school. It had been promptly
given me, I have noted, to face that mystery
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
without a pang. Perhaps even it would be
nearer the truth to say that&mdash;without a word&mdash;he
himself had cleared it up. He had made the
whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed
there with the real rose-flush of his innocence:
he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid,
unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for
it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such
differences, such superiorities of quality, always,
on the part of the majority&mdash;which could include
even stupid, sordid head-masters&mdash;turns infallibly
to the vindictive.</p>

<p>Both the children had a gentleness (it was
their only fault, and it never made Miles a
muff) that kept them&mdash;how shall I express it?&mdash;almost
impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable.
They were like the cherubs of the
anecdote, who had&mdash;morally, at any rate&mdash;nothing
to whack! I remember feeling with
Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were,
no history. We expect of a small child a scant
one, but there was in this beautiful little boy
something extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily
happy, that, more than in any creature
of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning
anew each day. He had never for a second suffered.
I took this as a direct disproof of his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
having really been chastised. If he had been
wicked he would have “caught” it, and I should
have caught it by the rebound&mdash;I should have
found the trace. I found nothing at all, and he
was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his
school, never mentioned a comrade or a master;
and I, for my part, was quite too much disgusted
to allude to them. Of course I was under the
spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the
time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself
up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I
had more pains than one. I was in receipt in
these days of disturbing letters from home, where
things were not going well. But with my children,
what things in the world mattered? That
was the question I used to put to my scrappy
retirements. I was dazzled by their loveliness.</p>

<p>There was a Sunday&mdash;to get on&mdash;when it
rained with such force and for so many hours
that there could be no procession to church; in
consequence of which, as the day declined, I had
arranged with Mrs. Grose that, should the evening
show improvement, we would attend together
the late service. The rain happily stopped,
and I prepared for our walk, which, through the
park and by the good road to the village, would
be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming downstairs
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered
a pair of gloves that had required three
stitches and that had received them&mdash;with a
publicity perhaps not edifying&mdash;while I sat with
the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by
exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany
and brass, the “grown-up” dining-room. The
gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in
to recover them. The day was grey enough, but
the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled
me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognise,
on a chair near the wide window, then
closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware
of a person on the other side of the window and
looking straight in. One step into the room had
sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all
there. The person looking straight in was the
person who had already appeared to me. He
appeared thus again with I won’t say greater distinctness,
for that was impossible, but with a
nearness that represented a forward stride in our
intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my
breath and turn cold. He was the same&mdash;he
was the same, and seen, this time, as he had been
seen before, from the waist up, the window,
though the dining-room was on the ground-floor,
not going down to the terrace on which he stood.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of
this better view was, strangely, only to show me
how intense the former had been. He remained
but a few seconds&mdash;long enough to convince me
he also saw and recognised; but it was as if I
had been looking at him for years and had known
him always. Something, however, happened this
time that had not happened before; his stare
into my face, through the glass and across the
room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted
me for a moment during which I could still watch
it, see it fix successively several other things.
On the spot there came to me the added shock
of a certitude that it was not for me he had come
there. He had come for someone else.</p>

<p>The flash of this knowledge&mdash;for it was
knowledge in the midst of dread&mdash;produced in
me the most extraordinary effect, started, as I
stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and
courage. I say courage because I was beyond
all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight
out of the door again, reached that of the house,
got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing
along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned
a corner and came full in sight. But it was in
sight of nothing now&mdash;my visitor had vanished.
I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
of this; but I took in the whole scene&mdash;I gave
him time to reappear. I call it time, but how
long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose today
of the duration of these things. That kind of
measure must have left me: they couldn’t have
lasted as they actually appeared to me to last.
The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and
the garden beyond it, all I could see of the
park, were empty with a great emptiness. There
were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember
the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed
him. He was there or was not there:
not there if I didn’t see him. I got hold of
this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as
I had come, went to the window. It was confusedly
present to me that I ought to place
myself where he had stood. I did so; I applied
my face to the pane and looked, as he had
looked, into the room. As if, at this moment,
to show me exactly what his range had been,
Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before,
came in from the hall. With this I had the
full image of a repetition of what had already
occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own
visitant; she pulled up short as I had done;
I gave her something of the shock that I had
received. She turned white, and this made me
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
ask myself if I had blanched as much. She
stared, in short, and retreated on just <em>my</em> lines,
and I knew she had then passed out and come
round to me and that I should presently meet
her. I remained where I was, and while I
waited I thought of more things than one. But
there’s only one I take space to mention. I
wondered why <em>she</em> should be scared.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>V</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">Oh</span>, she let me know as soon as, round the
corner of the house, she loomed again into view.
“What in the name of goodness is the matter<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”
She was now flushed and out of
breath.</p>

<p>I said nothing till she came quite near. “With
me?” I must have made a wonderful face. “Do
I show it?”</p>

<p>“You’re as white as a sheet. You look awful.”</p>

<p>I considered; I could meet on this, without
scruple, any innocence. My need to respect the
bloom of Mrs. Grose’s had dropped, without a
rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for
the instant it was not with what I kept back.
I put out my hand to her and she took it; I
held her hard a little, liking to feel her close to
me. There was a kind of support in the shy
heave of her surprise. “You came for me for
church, of course, but I can’t go.”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>“Yes. You must know now. Did I look very
queer?”</p>

<p>“Through this window? Dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I’ve been frightened.” Mrs.
Grose’s eyes expressed plainly that <em>she</em> had no
wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her
place not to be ready to share with me any
marked inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled
that she <em>must</em> share! “Just what you saw
from the dining-room a minute ago was the effect
of that. What <em>I</em> saw&mdash;just before&mdash;was much
worse.”</p>

<p>Her hand tightened. “What was it?”</p>

<p>“An extraordinary man. Looking in.”</p>

<p>“What extraordinary man?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose gazed round us in vain. “Then
where is he gone?”</p>

<p>“I know still less.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him before?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;once. On the old tower.”</p>

<p>She could only look at me harder. “Do you
mean he’s a stranger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very much!”</p>

<p>“Yet you didn’t tell me?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;for reasons. But now that you’ve
guessed<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>Mrs. Grose’s round eyes encountered this
charge. “Ah, I haven’t guessed!” she said very
simply. “How can I if <em>you</em> don’t imagine?”</p>

<p>“I don’t in the very least.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?”</p>

<p>“And on this spot just now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose looked round again. “What was
he doing on the tower?”</p>

<p>“Only standing there and looking down at me.”</p>

<p>She thought a minute. “Was he a gentleman?”</p>

<p>I found I had no need to think. “No.” She
gazed in deeper wonder. “No.”</p>

<p>“Then nobody about the place? Nobody from
the village?”</p>

<p>“Nobody&mdash;nobody. I didn’t tell you, but
I made sure.”</p>

<p>She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly,
so much to the good. It only went indeed a
little way. “But if he isn’t a gentleman<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> he? He’s a horror.”</p>

<p>“A horror?”</p>

<p>“He’s&mdash;God help me if I know <em>what</em> he is!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed
her eyes on the duskier distance, then, pulling
herself together, turned to me with abrupt inconsequence.
“It’s time we should be at church.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not fit for church!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>“Won’t it do you good?”</p>

<p>“It won’t do <em>them</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” I nodded at the
house.</p>

<p>“The children?”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave them now.”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>I spoke boldly. “I’m afraid of <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose’s large face showed me, at this, for
the first time, the far-away faint glimmer of a
consciousness more acute: I somehow made out
in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had
not given her and that was as yet quite obscure
to me. It comes back to me that I thought
instantly of this as something I could get from
her; and I felt it to be connected with the desire
she presently showed to know more. “When
was it&mdash;on the tower?”</p>

<p>“About the middle of the month. At this
same hour.”</p>

<p>“Almost at dark,” said Mrs. Grose.</p>

<p>“Oh no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.”</p>

<p>“Then how did he get in?”</p>

<p>“And how did he get out?” I laughed. “I
had no opportunity to ask him! This evening,
you see,” I pursued, “he has not been able to
get in.”</p>

<p>“He only peeps?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>“I hope it will be confined to that!” She had
now let go my hand; she turned away a little.
I waited an instant; then I brought out: “Go to
church. Good-bye. I must watch.”</p>

<p>Slowly she faced me again. “Do you fear for
them?”</p>

<p>We met in another long look. “Don’t <em>you</em>?”
Instead of answering she came nearer to the window
and, for a minute, applied her face to the
glass. “You see how he could see,” I meanwhile
went on.</p>

<p>She didn’t move. “How long was he here?”</p>

<p>“Till I came out. I came to meet him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was
still more in her face. “<em>I</em> couldn’t have come
out.”</p>

<p>“Neither could I!” I laughed again. “But I
did come. I have my duty.”</p>

<p>“So have I mine,” she replied; after which she
added: “What is he like?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been dying to tell you. But he’s like
nobody.”</p>

<p>“Nobody?” she echoed.</p>

<p>“He has no hat.” Then seeing in her face that
she already, in this, with a deeper dismay, found a
touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to stroke.
“He has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
pale face, long in shape, with straight, good features
and little, rather queer whiskers that are as
red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow,
darker; they look particularly arched and as if
they might move a good deal. His eyes are
sharp, strange&mdash;awfully; but I only know clearly
that they’re rather small and very fixed. His
mouth’s wide, and his lips are thin, and except for
his little whiskers he’s quite clean-shaven. He
gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.”</p>

<p>“An actor!” It was impossible to resemble
one less, at least, than Mrs. Grose at that moment.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen one, but so I suppose them.
He’s tall, active, erect,” I continued, “but never&mdash;no,
never!&mdash;a gentleman.”</p>

<p>My companion’s face had blanched as I went
on; her round eyes started and her mild mouth
gaped. “A gentleman?” she gasped, confounded,
stupefied: “a gentleman <em>he</em>?”</p>

<p>“You know him then?”</p>

<p>She visibly tried to hold herself. “But he <em>is</em>
handsome?”</p>

<p>I saw the way to help her. “Remarkably!”</p>

<p>“And dressed<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“In somebody’s clothes. They’re smart, but
they’re not his own.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>She broke into a breathless affirmative groan.
“They’re the master’s!”</p>

<p>I caught it up. “You <em>do</em> know him?”</p>

<p>She faltered but a second. “Quint!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Quint?”</p>

<p>“Peter Quint&mdash;his own man, his valet, when
he was here!”</p>

<p>“When the master was?”</p>

<p>Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it
all together. “He never wore his hat, but he
did wear&mdash;well, there were waistcoats missed!
They were both here&mdash;last year. Then the
master went, and Quint was alone.”</p>

<p>I followed, but halting a little. “Alone?”</p>

<p>“Alone with <em>us</em>.” Then, as from a deeper
depth, “In charge,” she added.</p>

<p>“And what became of him?”</p>

<p>She hung fire so long that I was still more
mystified. “He went too,” she brought out at
last.</p>

<p>“Went where?”</p>

<p>Her expression, at this, became extraordinary.
“God knows where! He died.”</p>

<p>“Died?” I almost shrieked.</p>

<p>She seemed fairly to square herself, plant
herself more firmly to utter the wonder of it.
“Yes. Mr. Quint is dead.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>VI</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">It</span> took of course more than that particular
passage to place us together in presence of
what we had now to live with as we could&mdash;my
dreadful liability to impressions of the
order so vividly exemplified, and my companion’s
knowledge, henceforth,&mdash;a knowledge half
consternation and half compassion,&mdash;of that liability.
There had been, this evening, after the
revelation that left me, for an hour, so prostrate&mdash;there
had been, for either of us, no
attendance on any service but a little service
of tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a
climax to the series of mutual challenges and
pledges that had straightway ensued on our
retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting
ourselves up there to have everything out.
The result of our having everything out was
simply to reduce our situation to the last
rigour of its elements. She herself had seen
nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
in the house but the governess was in the
governess’s plight; yet she accepted without
directly impugning my sanity the truth as I
gave it to her, and ended by showing me, on
this ground, an awe-stricken tenderness, an expression
of the sense of my more than questionable
privilege, of which the very breath has
remained with me as that of the sweetest of
human charities.</p>

<p>What was settled between us, accordingly, that
night, was that we thought we might bear things
together; and I was not even sure that, in spite
of her exemption, it was she who had the best of
the burden. I knew at this hour, I think, as well
as I knew later what I was capable of meeting to
shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to
be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared
for to keep terms with so compromising a
contract. I was queer company enough&mdash;quite
as queer as the company I received; but as I
trace over what we went through I see how much
common ground we must have found in the one
idea that, by good fortune, <em>could</em> steady us. It
was the idea, the second movement, that led me
straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber
of my dread. I could take the air in the court,
at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>
Perfectly can I recall now the particular way
strength came to me before we separated for the
night. We had gone over and over every feature
of what I had seen.</p>

<p>“He was looking for someone else, you say&mdash;someone
who was not you?”</p>

<p>“He was looking for little Miles.” A portentous
clearness now possessed me. “<em>That’s</em> whom
he was looking for.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know?”</p>

<p>“I know, I know, I know!” My exaltation
grew. “And <em>you</em> know, my dear!”</p>

<p>She didn’t deny this, but I required, I felt, not
even so much telling as that. She resumed in a
moment, at any rate: “What if <em>he</em> should see
him?”</p>

<p>“Little Miles? That’s what he wants!”</p>

<p>She looked immensely scared again. “The
child?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid! The man. He wants to
appear to <em>them</em>.” That he might was an awful
conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at
bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was
what I succeeded in practically proving. I had
an absolute certainty that I should see again what
I had already seen, but something within me said
that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
of such experience, by accepting, by inviting, by
surmounting it all, I should serve as an expiatory
victim and guard the tranquillity of my companions.
The children, in especial, I should thus
fence about and absolutely save. I recall one of
the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.</p>

<p>“It does strike me that my pupils have never
mentioned<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>She looked at me hard as I musingly pulled up.
“His having been here and the time they were
with him?”</p>

<p>“The time they were with him, and his name,
his presence, his history, in any way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the little lady doesn’t remember. She
never heard or knew.”</p>

<p>“The circumstances of his death?” I thought
with some intensity. “Perhaps not. But Miles
would remember&mdash;Miles would know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t try him!” broke from Mrs. Grose.</p>

<p>I returned her the look she had given me.
“Don’t be afraid.” I continued to think. “It
is rather odd.”</p>

<p>“That he has never spoken of him?”</p>

<p>“Never by the least allusion. And you tell me
they were ‘great friends’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t <em>him</em>!” Mrs. Grose with emphasis
declared. “It was Quint’s own fancy. To
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
play with him, I mean&mdash;to spoil him.” She
paused a moment; then she added: “Quint was
much too free.”</p>

<p>This gave me, straight from my vision of his
face&mdash;<em>such</em> a face!&mdash;a sudden sickness of disgust.
“Too free with <em>my</em> boy?”</p>

<p>“Too free with everyone!”</p>

<p>I forbore, for the moment, to analyse this description
further than by the reflection that a part
of it applied to several of the members of the
household, of the half-dozen maids and men who
were still of our small colony. But there was
everything, for our apprehension, in the lucky
fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation
of scullions, had ever, within anyone’s
memory, attached to the kind old place. It had
neither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose,
most apparently, only desired to cling to me and
to quake in silence. I even put her, the very last
thing of all, to the test. It was when, at midnight,
she had her hand on the schoolroom door
to take leave. “I have it from you then&mdash;for it’s
of great importance&mdash;that he was definitely and
admittedly bad?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not admittedly. <em>I</em> knew it&mdash;but the
master didn’t.”</p>

<p>“And you never told him?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>“Well, he didn’t like tale-bearing&mdash;he hated
complaints. He was terribly short with anything
of that kind, and if people were all right
to <em>him</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be bothered with more?” This
squared well enough with my impression of him:
he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so
very particular perhaps about some of the company
<em>he</em> kept. All the same, I pressed my interlocutress.
“I promise you <em>I</em> would have
told!”</p>

<p>She felt my discrimination. “I dare say I
was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of what?”</p>

<p>“Of things that man could do. Quint was so
clever&mdash;he was so deep.”</p>

<p>I took this in still more than, probably, I
showed. “You weren’t afraid of anything else?
Not of his effect<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“His effect?” she repeated with a face of
anguish and waiting while I faltered.</p>

<p>“On innocent little precious lives. They were
in your charge.”</p>

<p>“No, they were not in mine!” she roundly and
distressfully returned. “The master believed in
him and placed him here because he was supposed
not to be well and the country air so good for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
him. So he had everything to say. Yes”&mdash;she
let me have it&mdash;“even about <em>them</em>.”</p>

<p>“Them&mdash;that creature?” I had to smother a
kind of howl. “And you could bear it!”</p>

<p>“No. I couldn’t&mdash;and I can’t now!” And
the poor woman burst into tears.</p>

<p>A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I
have said, to follow them; yet how often and how
passionately, for a week, we came back together
to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that
Sunday night, I was, in the immediate later hours
in especial&mdash;for it may be imagined whether I
slept&mdash;still haunted with the shadow of something
she had not told me. I myself had kept
back nothing, but there was a word Mrs. Grose
had kept back. I was sure, moreover, by morning,
that this was not from a failure of frankness,
but because on every side there were fears. It
seems to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the
time the morrow’s sun was high I had restlessly
read into the facts before us almost all the meaning
they were to receive from subsequent and
more cruel occurrences. What they gave me
above all was just the sinister figure of the living
man&mdash;the dead one would keep awhile!&mdash;and
of the months he had continuously passed at Bly,
which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
limit of this evil time had arrived only when, on
the dawn of a winter’s morning, Peter Quint was
found, by a labourer going to early work, stone
dead on the road from the village: a catastrophe
explained&mdash;superficially at least&mdash;by a visible
wound to his head; such a wound as might have
been produced&mdash;and as, on the final evidence,
<em>had</em> been&mdash;by a fatal slip, in the dark and after
leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope,
a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which
he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night
and in liquor, accounted for much&mdash;practically,
in the end and after the inquest and boundless
chatter, for everything; but there had been matters
in his life&mdash;strange passages and perils, secret
disorders, vices more than suspected&mdash;that
would have accounted for a good deal more.</p>

<p>I scarce know how to put my story into words
that shall be a credible picture of my state of
mind; but I was in these days literally able to
find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism
the occasion demanded of me. I now saw that
I had been asked for a service admirable and
difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting
it be seen&mdash;oh, in the right quarter!&mdash;that
I could succeed where many another girl
might have failed. It was an immense help to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
me&mdash;I confess I rather applaud myself as I look
back!&mdash;that I saw my service so strongly and
so simply. I was there to protect and defend
the little creatures in the world the most bereaved
and the most loveable, the appeal of whose
helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit,
a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed
heart. We were cut off, really, together;
we were united in our danger. They had nothing
but me, and I&mdash;well, I had <em>them</em>. It was in
short a magnificent chance. This chance presented
itself to me in an image richly material.
I was a screen&mdash;I was to stand before them.
The more I saw, the less they would. I began
to watch them in a stifled suspense, a disguised
excitement that might well, had it continued too
long, have turned to something like madness.
What saved me, as I now see, was that it turned
to something else altogether. It didn’t last as
suspense&mdash;it was superseded by horrible proofs.
Proofs, I say, yes&mdash;from the moment I really
took hold.</p>

<p>This moment dated from an afternoon hour
that I happened to spend in the grounds with
the younger of my pupils alone. We had left
Miles indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window-seat;
he had wished to finish a book, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable
in a young man whose only defect was an
occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on
the contrary, had been alert to come out, and I
strolled with her half an hour, seeking the shade,
for the sun was still high and the day exceptionally
warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we
went, of how, like her brother, she contrived&mdash;it
was the charming thing in both children&mdash;to
let me alone without appearing to drop me and
to accompany me without appearing to surround.
They were never importunate and yet never listless.
My attention to them all really went to
seeing them amuse themselves immensely without
me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively
to prepare and that engaged me as an
active admirer. I walked in a world of their
invention&mdash;they had no occasion whatever to
draw upon mine; so that my time was taken
only with being, for them, some remarkable
person or thing that the game of the moment
required and that was merely, thanks to my superior,
my exalted stamp, a happy and highly
distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on
the present occasion; I only remember that I
was something very important and very quiet
and that Flora was playing very hard. We were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>
on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately
begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became
aware that, on the other side of the Sea of
Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way
this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest
thing in the world&mdash;the strangest, that is,
except the very much stranger in which it
quickly merged itself. I had sat down with
a piece of work&mdash;for I was something or other
that could sit&mdash;on the old stone bench which
overlooked the pond; and in this position I
began to take in with certitude, and yet without
direct vision, the presence, at a distance,
of a third person. The old trees, the thick
shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade,
but it was all suffused with the brightness of
the hot, still hour. There was no ambiguity
in anything; none whatever, at least, in the
conviction I from one moment to another found
myself forming as to what I should see straight
before me and across the lake as a consequence
of raising my eyes. They were attached at this
juncture to the stitching in which I was engaged,
and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort
not to move them till I should so have steadied
myself as to be able to make up my mind what
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
to do. There was an alien object in view&mdash;a
figure whose right of presence I instantly, passionately
questioned. I recollect counting over
perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that
nothing was more natural, for instance, than the
appearance of one of the men about the place,
or even of a messenger, a postman or a tradesman’s
boy, from the village. That reminder had
as little effect on my practical certitude as I was
conscious&mdash;still even without looking&mdash;of its
having upon the character and attitude of our
visitor. Nothing was more natural than that
these things should be the other things that
they absolutely were not.</p>

<p>Of the positive identity of the apparition I
would assure myself as soon as the small clock
of my courage should have ticked out the right
second; meanwhile, with an effort that was
already sharp enough, I transferred my eyes
straight to little Flora, who, at the moment,
was about ten yards away. My heart had stood
still for an instant with the wonder and terror
of the question whether she too would see; and
I held my breath while I waited for what a cry
from her, what some sudden innocent sign either
of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited,
but nothing came; then, in the first place&mdash;and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
there is something more dire in this, I feel, than
in anything I have to relate&mdash;I was determined
by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from
her had previously dropped; and, in the second,
by the circumstance that, also within the minute,
she had, in her play, turned her back to the
water. This was her attitude when I at last
looked at her&mdash;looked with the confirmed conviction
that we were still, together, under direct
personal notice. She had picked up a small flat
piece of wood, which happened to have in it a
little hole that had evidently suggested to her
the idea of sticking in another fragment that
might figure as a mast and make the thing a
boat. This second morsel, as I watched her,
she was very markedly and intently attempting
to tighten in its place. My apprehension of
what she was doing sustained me so that after
some seconds I felt I was ready for more. Then
I again shifted my eyes&mdash;I faced what I had
to face.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>VII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">I got</span> hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as
I could; and I can give no intelligible account
of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still
hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into
her arms: “They <em>know</em>&mdash;it’s too monstrous:
they know, they know!”</p>

<p>“And what on earth<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” I felt her incredulity
as she held me.</p>

<p>“Why, all that <em>we</em> know&mdash;and heaven knows
what else besides!” Then, as she released me,
I made it out to her, made it out perhaps only
now with full coherency even to myself. “Two
hours ago, in the garden”&mdash;I could scarce articulate&mdash;“Flora
<em>saw</em>!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a
blow in the stomach. “She has told you?” she
panted.</p>

<p>“Not a word&mdash;that’s the horror. She kept it
to herself! The child of eight, <em>that</em> child!”
Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction
of it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>Mrs. Grose, of course, could only gape the
wider. “Then how do you know?”</p>

<p>“I was there&mdash;I saw with my eyes: saw that
she was perfectly aware.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean aware of <em>him</em>?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;of <em>her</em>.” I was conscious as I spoke
that I looked prodigious things, for I got the
slow reflection of them in my companion’s face.
“Another person&mdash;this time; but a figure of
quite as unmistakeable horror and evil: a woman
in black, pale and dreadful&mdash;with such an air
also, and such a face!&mdash;on the other side of the
lake. I was there with the child&mdash;quiet for the
hour; and in the midst of it she came.”</p>

<p>“Came how&mdash;from where?”</p>

<p>“From where they come from! She just appeared
and stood there&mdash;but not so near.”</p>

<p>“And without coming nearer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might
have been as close as you!”</p>

<p>My friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a
step. “Was she someone you’ve never seen?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But someone the child has. Someone
<em>you</em> have.” Then, to show how I had thought
it all out: “My predecessor&mdash;the one who
died.”</p>

<p>“Miss Jessel?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>“Miss Jessel. You don’t believe me?” I
pressed.</p>

<p>She turned right and left in her distress.
“How can you be sure?”</p>

<p>This drew from me, in the state of my nerves,
a flash of impatience. “Then ask Flora&mdash;<em>she’s</em>
sure!” But I had no sooner spoken than I
caught myself up. “No, for God’s sake, <em>don’t</em>!
She’ll say she isn’t&mdash;she’ll lie!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose was not too bewildered instinctively
to protest. “Ah, how <em>can</em> you?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m clear. Flora doesn’t want me to
know.”</p>

<p>“It’s only then to spare you.”</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;there are depths, depths! The more
I go over it, the more I see in it, and the more I
see in it the more I fear. I don’t know what I
<em>don’t</em> see&mdash;what I <em>don’t</em> fear!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. “You
mean you’re afraid of seeing her again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; that’s nothing&mdash;now!” Then I explained.
“It’s of <em>not</em> seeing her.”</p>

<p>But my companion only looked wan. “I don’t
understand you.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s that the child may keep it up&mdash;and
that the child assuredly <em>will</em>&mdash;without my
knowing it.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>At the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for
a moment collapsed, yet presently to pull herself
together again, as if from the positive force of the
sense of what, should we yield an inch, there
would really be to give way to. “Dear, dear&mdash;we
must keep our heads! And after all, if she
doesn’t mind it<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” She even tried a grim
joke. “Perhaps she likes it!”</p>

<p>“Likes <em>such</em> things&mdash;a scrap of an infant!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?”
my friend bravely inquired.</p>

<p>She brought me, for the instant, almost round.
“Oh, we must clutch at <em>that</em>&mdash;we must cling to
it! If it isn’t a proof of what you say, it’s a
proof of&mdash;God knows what! For the woman’s
a horror of horrors.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on
the ground; then at last raising them, “Tell me
how you know,” she said.</p>

<p>“Then you admit it’s what she was?” I
cried.</p>

<p>“Tell me how you know,” my friend simply
repeated.</p>

<p>“Know? By seeing her! By the way she
looked.”</p>

<p>“At you, do you mean&mdash;so wickedly?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no&mdash;I could have borne that.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
She gave me never a glance. She only fixed
the child.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose tried to see it. “Fixed her?”</p>

<p>“Ah, with such awful eyes!”</p>

<p>She stared at mine as if they might really have
resembled them. “Do you mean of dislike?”</p>

<p>“God help us, no. Of something much
worse.”</p>

<p>“Worse than dislike?”&mdash;this left her indeed
at a loss.</p>

<p>“With a determination&mdash;indescribable. With
a kind of fury of intention.”</p>

<p>I made her turn pale. “Intention?”</p>

<p>“To get hold of her.” Mrs. Grose&mdash;her
eyes just lingering on mine&mdash;gave a shudder
and walked to the window; and while she
stood there looking out I completed my statement.
“<em>That’s</em> what Flora knows.”</p>

<p>After a little she turned round. “The person
was in black, you say?”</p>

<p>“In mourning&mdash;rather poor, almost shabby.
But&mdash;yes&mdash;with extraordinary beauty.” I now
recognised to what I had at last, stroke by
stroke, brought the victim of my confidence, for
she quite visibly weighed this. “Oh, handsome&mdash;very,
very,” I insisted; “wonderfully
handsome. But infamous.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>She slowly came back to me. “Miss Jessel&mdash;<em>was</em>
infamous.” She once more took my
hand in both her own, holding it as tight as
if to fortify me against the increase of alarm
I might draw from this disclosure. “They were
both infamous,” she finally said.</p>

<p>So, for a little, we faced it once more together;
and I found absolutely a degree of
help in seeing it now so straight. “I appreciate,”
I said, “the great decency of your not
having hitherto spoken; but the time has certainly
come to give me the whole thing.” She
appeared to assent to this, but still only in
silence; seeing which I went on: “I must
have it now. Of what did she die? Come,
there was something between them.”</p>

<p>“There was everything.”</p>

<p>“In spite of the difference<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of their rank, their condition”&mdash;she
brought it woefully out. “<em>She</em> was a lady.”</p>

<p>I turned it over; I again saw. “Yes&mdash;she
was a lady.”</p>

<p>“And he so dreadfully below,” said Mrs.
Grose.</p>

<p>I felt that I doubtless needn’t press too hard,
in such company, on the place of a servant in
the scale; but there was nothing to prevent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
an acceptance of my companion’s own measure
of my predecessor’s abasement. There was a
way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more
readily for my full vision&mdash;on the evidence&mdash;of
our employer’s late clever, good-looking
“own” man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved.
“The fellow was a hound.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps
a little a case for a sense of shades. “I’ve
never seen one like him. He did what he
wished.”</p>

<p>“With <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p>“With them all.”</p>

<p>It was as if now in my friend’s own eyes
Miss Jessel had again appeared. I seemed at
any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation
of her as distinctly as I had seen her by the
pond; and I brought out with decision: “It
must have been also what <em>she</em> wished!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose’s face signified that it had been
indeed, but she said at the same time: “Poor
woman&mdash;she paid for it!”</p>

<p>“Then you do know what she died of?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I know nothing. I wanted not to
know; I was glad enough I didn’t; and I
thanked heaven she was well out of this!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>“Yet you had, then, your idea<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Of her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes&mdash;as
to that. She couldn’t have stayed. Fancy
it here&mdash;for a governess! And afterwards I
imagined&mdash;and I still imagine. And what I
imagine is dreadful.”</p>

<p>“Not so dreadful as what <em>I</em> do,” I replied;
on which I must have shown her&mdash;as I was
indeed but too conscious&mdash;a front of miserable
defeat. It brought out again all her compassion
for me, and at the renewed touch of her kindness
my power to resist broke down. I burst,
as I had, the other time, made her burst, into
tears; she took me to her motherly breast, and
my lamentation overflowed. “I don’t do it!”
I sobbed in despair; “I don’t save or shield
them! It’s far worse than I dreamed&mdash;they’re
lost!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>VIII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">What</span> I had said to Mrs. Grose was true
enough: there were in the matter I had put
before her depths and possibilities that I lacked
resolution to sound; so that when we met once
more in the wonder of it we were of a common
mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant
fancies. We were to keep our heads if we
should keep nothing else&mdash;difficult indeed as
that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious
experience, was least to be questioned.
Late that night, while the house slept, we had
another talk in my room, when she went all
the way with me as to its being beyond doubt
that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To
hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found
I had only to ask her how, if I had “made it
up,” I came to be able to give, of each of the
persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing,
to the last detail, their special marks&mdash;a portrait
on the exhibition of which she had instantly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
recognised and named them. She wished,
of course,&mdash;small blame to her!&mdash;to sink the
whole subject; and I was quick to assure her
that my own interest in it had now violently
taken the form of a search for the way to escape
from it. I encountered her on the ground of a
probability that with recurrence&mdash;for recurrence
we took for granted&mdash;I should get used to my
danger, distinctly professing that my personal
exposure had suddenly become the least of my
discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was
intolerable; and yet even to this complication the
later hours of the day had brought a little ease.</p>

<p>On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had
of course returned to my pupils, associating the
right remedy for my dismay with that sense of
their charm which I had already found to be a
thing I could positively cultivate and which had
never failed me yet. I had simply, in other
words, plunged afresh into Flora’s special society
and there become aware&mdash;it was almost a
luxury!&mdash;that she could put her little conscious
hand straight upon the spot that ached. She
had looked at me in sweet speculation and then
had accused me to my face of having “cried.”
I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly
signs: but I could literally&mdash;for the time, at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
all events&mdash;rejoice, under this fathomless charity,
that they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze
into the depths of blue of the child’s eyes and
pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature
cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference
to which I naturally preferred to abjure my
judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation.
I couldn’t abjure for merely wanting to, but I
could repeat to Mrs. Grose&mdash;as I did there, over
and over, in the small hours&mdash;that with their
voices in the air, their pressure on one’s heart
and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek,
everything fell to the ground but their incapacity
and their beauty. It was a pity that,
somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally
to re-enumerate the signs of subtlety that, in the
afternoon, by the lake, had made a miracle of
my show of self-possession. It was a pity to
be obliged to re-investigate the certitude of the
moment itself and repeat how it had come to me
as a revelation that the inconceivable communion
I then surprised was a matter, for either party,
of habit. It was a pity that I should have had
to quaver out again the reasons for my not having,
in my delusion, so much as questioned that
the little girl saw our visitant even as I actually
saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>
just so much as she did thus see, to make
me suppose she didn’t, and at the same time,
without showing anything, arrive at a guess as
to whether I myself did! It was a pity that
I needed once more to describe the portentous
little activity by which she sought to divert my
attention&mdash;the perceptible increase of movement,
the greater intensity of play, the singing, the
gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.</p>

<p>Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was
nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed
the two or three dim elements of comfort that
still remained to me. I should not for instance
have been able to asseverate to my friend that
I was certain&mdash;which was so much to the good&mdash;that
<em>I</em> at least had not betrayed myself. I
should not have been prompted, by stress of
need, by desperation of mind,&mdash;I scarce know
what to call it,&mdash;to invoke such further aid to
intelligence as might spring from pushing my
colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me,
bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a
small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still
sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a
bat; and I remember how on this occasion&mdash;for
the sleeping house and the concentration alike of
our danger and our watch seemed to help&mdash;I felt
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain.
“I don’t believe anything so horrible,” I
recollect saying; “no, let us put it definitely,
my dear, that I don’t. But if I did, you know,
there’s a thing I should require now, just without
sparing you the least bit more&mdash;oh, not a scrap,
come!&mdash;to get out of you. What was it you
had in mind when, in our distress, before Miles
came back, over the letter from his school, you
said, under my insistence, that you didn’t pretend
for him that he had not literally <em>ever</em> been
‘bad’? He has <em>not</em> literally ‘ever,’ in these
weeks that I myself have lived with him and
so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable
little prodigy of delightful, loveable
goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have
made the claim for him if you had not, as it
happened, seen an exception to take. What was
your exception, and to what passage in your personal
observation of him did you refer?”</p>

<p>It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity
was not our note, and, at any rate, before the grey
dawn admonished us to separate I had got my
answer. What my friend had had in mind
proved to be immensely to the purpose. It was
neither more nor less than the circumstance that
for a period of several months Quint and the boy
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
had been perpetually together. It was in fact the
very appropriate truth that she had ventured to
criticise the propriety, to hint at the incongruity,
of so close an alliance, and even to go so far on
the subject as a frank overture to Miss Jessel.
Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,
requested her to mind her business, and the good
woman had, on this, directly approached little
Miles. What she had said to him, since I pressed,
was that <em>she</em> liked to see young gentlemen not
forget their station.</p>

<p>I pressed again, of course, at this. “You reminded
him that Quint was only a base menial?”</p>

<p>“As you might say! And it was his answer,
for one thing, that was bad.”</p>

<p>“And for another thing?” I waited. “He
repeated your words to Quint?”</p>

<p>“No, not that. It’s just what he <em>wouldn’t</em>!”
she could still impress upon me. “I was sure, at
any rate,” she added, “that he didn’t. But he
denied certain occasions.”</p>

<p>“What occasions?”</p>

<p>“When they had been about together quite as
if Quint were his tutor&mdash;and a very grand one&mdash;and
Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When
he had gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent
hours with him.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>“He then prevaricated about it&mdash;he said he
hadn’t?” Her assent was clear enough to cause
me to add in a moment: “I see. He lied.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a
suggestion that it didn’t matter; which indeed
she backed up by a further remark. “You see,
after all, Miss Jessel didn’t mind. She didn’t
forbid him.”</p>

<p>I considered. “Did he put that to you as a
justification?”</p>

<p>At this she dropped again. “No, he never
spoke of it.”</p>

<p>“Never mentioned her in connection with
Quint?”</p>

<p>She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming
out. “Well, he didn’t show anything. He
denied,” she repeated; “he denied.”</p>

<p>Lord, how I pressed her now! “So that you
could see he knew what was between the two
wretches?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;I don’t know!” the poor
woman groaned.</p>

<p>“You do know, you dear thing,” I replied;
“only you haven’t my dreadful boldness of mind,
and you keep back, out of timidity and modesty
and delicacy, even the impression that, in the past,
when you had, without my aid, to flounder about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
in silence, most of all made you miserable. But
I shall get it out of you yet! There was something
in the boy that suggested to you,” I continued,
“that he covered and concealed their relation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he couldn’t prevent<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Your learning the truth? I dare say! But,
heavens,” I fell, with vehemence, a-thinking,
“what it shows that they must, to that extent,
have succeeded in making of him!”</p>

<p>“Ah, nothing that’s not nice <em>now</em>!” Mrs. Grose
lugubriously pleaded.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you looked queer,” I persisted,
“when I mentioned to you the letter from
his school!”</p>

<p>“I doubt if I looked as queer as you!” she
retorted with homely force. “And if he was so
bad then as that comes to, how is he such an
angel now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed&mdash;and if he was a fiend at school!
How, how, how? Well,” I said in my torment,
“you must put it to me again, but I shall not be
able to tell you for some days. Only, put it to
me again!” I cried in a way that made my friend
stare. “There are directions in which I must
not for the present let myself go.” Meanwhile
I returned to her first example&mdash;the one to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
which she had just previously referred&mdash;of the
boy’s happy capacity for an occasional slip. “If
Quint&mdash;on your remonstrance at the time you
speak of&mdash;was a base menial, one of the things
Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was
that you were another.” Again her admission
was so adequate that I continued: “And you
forgave him that?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” And we exchanged there, in the
stillness, a sound of the oddest amusement. Then
I went on: “At all events, while he was with
the man<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited
them all!”</p>

<p>It suited me too, I felt, only too well; by
which I mean that it suited exactly the particularly
deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding
myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded
in checking the expression of this view
that I will throw, just here, no further light on
it than may be offered by the mention of my
final observation to Mrs. Grose. “His having
lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging
specimens than I had hoped to have
from you of the outbreak in him of the little
natural man. Still,” I mused, “they must do,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
for they make me feel more than ever that I
must watch.”</p>

<p>It made me blush, the next minute, to see in
my friend’s face how much more unreservedly
she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck
me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion
for doing. This came out when, at the
schoolroom door, she quitted me. “Surely you
don’t accuse <em>him</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals
from me? Ah, remember that, until further
evidence, I now accuse nobody.” Then, before
shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her
own place, “I must just wait,” I wound up.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>IX</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">I waited</span> and waited, and the days, as they
elapsed, took something from my consternation.
A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant
sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident,
sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to
odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge.
I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary
childish grace as a thing I could
actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I
neglected now to address myself to this source
for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I
can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle
against my new lights; it would doubtless have
been, however, a greater tension still had it not
been so frequently successful. I used to wonder
how my little charges could help guessing that
I thought strange things about them; and the
circumstance that these things only made them
more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to
keeping them in the dark. I trembled lest they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
should see that they <em>were</em> so immensely more
interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all
events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding
of their innocence could only be&mdash;blameless
and foredoomed as they were&mdash;a reason the more
for taking risks. There were moments when, by
an irresistible impulse, I found myself catching
them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon
as I had done so I used to say to myself: “What
will they think of that? Doesn’t it betray too
much?” It would have been easy to get into a
sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray;
but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace
that I could still enjoy was that the immediate
charm of my companions was a beguilement still
effective even under the shadow of the possibility
that it was studied. For if it occurred to me that
I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little
outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, so too
I remember wondering if I mightn’t see a queerness
in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations.</p>

<p>They were at this period extravagantly and
preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I
could reflect, was no more than a graceful response
in children perpetually bowed over and hugged.
The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if
I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally
to catch them at a purpose in it. They had
never, I think, wanted to do so many things for
their poor protectress; I mean&mdash;though they got
their lessons better and better, which was naturally
what would please her most&mdash;in the way of
diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading
her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades,
pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals
and historical characters, and above all astonishing
her by the “pieces” they had secretly got
by heart and could interminably recite. I should
never get to the bottom&mdash;were I to let myself go
even now&mdash;of the prodigious private commentary,
all under still more private correction, with which,
in these days, I overscored their full hours. They
had shown me from the first a facility for everything,
a general faculty which, taking a fresh start,
achieved remarkable flights. They got their little
tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from
the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed
little miracles of memory. They not only
popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as
Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators.
This was so singularly the case that it had presumably
much to do with the fact as to which,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
at the present day, I am at a loss for a different
explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure
on the subject of another school for Miles. What
I remember is that I was content not, for the time,
to open the question, and that contentment must
have sprung from the sense of his perpetually
striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for
a bad governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil;
and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the
pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression
I might have got, if I had dared to work
it out, that he was under some influence operating
in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement.</p>

<p>If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a
boy could postpone school, it was at least as
marked that for such a boy to have been “kicked
out” by a school-master was a mystification without
end. Let me add that in their company now&mdash;and
I was careful almost never to be out of it&mdash;I
could follow no scent very far. We lived in
a cloud of music and love and success and private
theatricals. The musical sense in each of the
children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial
had a marvellous knack of catching and
repeating. The schoolroom piano broke into all
gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of
them going out in the highest spirits in order to
“come in” as something new. I had had brothers
myself, and it was no revelation to me that little
girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What
surpassed everything was that there was a little
boy in the world who could have for the inferior
age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration.
They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that
they never either quarrelled or complained is to
make the note of praise coarse for their quality of
sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped
into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of
little understandings between them by which one
of them should keep me occupied while the other
slipped away. There is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> side, I suppose, in
all diplomacy; but if my pupils practised upon
me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness.
It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull,
the grossness broke out.</p>

<p>I find that I really hang back; but I must
take my plunge. In going on with the record
of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge
the most liberal faith&mdash;for which I little care;
but&mdash;and this is another matter&mdash;I renew what
I myself suffered, I again push my way through
it to the end. There came suddenly an hour
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
after which, as I look back, the affair seems to
me to have been all pure suffering; but I have
at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest
road out is doubtless to advance. One evening&mdash;with
nothing to lead up or to prepare it&mdash;I
felt the cold touch of the impression that
had breathed on me the night of my arrival and
which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned,
I should probably have made little of in memory
had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated.
I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple
of candles. There was a roomful of old books
at Bly&mdash;last-century fiction, some of it, which,
to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown,
but never to so much as that of a stray specimen,
had reached the sequestered home and appealed
to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I remember
that the book I had in my hand was
Fielding’s <cite>Amelia</cite>; also that I was wholly awake.
I recall further both a general conviction that it
was horribly late and a particular objection to
looking at my watch. I figure, finally, that the
white curtain draping, in the fashion of those
days, the head of Flora’s little bed, shrouded, as
I had assured myself long before, the perfection
of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though
I was deeply interested in my author, I found
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell
all scattered, looking straight up from him and
hard at the door of my room. There was a
moment during which I listened, reminded of
the faint sense I had had, the first night, of there
being something undefineably astir in the house,
and noted the soft breath of the open casement
just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all
the marks of a deliberation that must have
seemed magnificent had there been anyone to
admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet,
and, taking a candle, went straight out of the
room and, from the passage, on which my light
made little impression, noiselessly closed and
locked the door.</p>

<p>I can say now neither what determined nor
what guided me, but I went straight along the
lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within
sight of the tall window that presided over the
great turn of the staircase. At this point I precipitately
found myself aware of three things.
They were practically simultaneous, yet they had
flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold
flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered
window, that the yielding dusk of earliest
morning rendered it unnecessary. Without it,
the next instant, I saw that there was someone
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>
on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I required
no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third
encounter with Quint. The apparition had
reached the landing half-way up and was therefore
on the spot nearest the window, where at
sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly
as it had fixed me from the tower and from the
garden. He knew me as well as I knew him;
and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer
in the high glass and another on the polish of the
oak stair below, we faced each other in our common
intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion,
a living, detestable, dangerous presence.
But that was not the wonder of wonders; I
reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance:
the circumstance that dread had unmistakeably
quitted me and that there was nothing in
me there that didn’t meet and measure him.</p>

<p>I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary
moment, but I had, thank God, no terror. And
he knew I had not&mdash;I found myself at the end
of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt,
in a fierce rigour of confidence, that if I stood
my ground a minute I should cease&mdash;for the
time, at least&mdash;to have him to reckon with; and
during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as
human and hideous as a real interview: hideous
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
just because it <em>was</em> human, as human as to have
met alone, in the small hours, in a sleeping house,
some enemy, some adventurer, some criminal. It
was the dead silence of our long gaze at such
close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge
as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I
had met a murderer in such a place and at such
an hour, we still at least would have spoken.
Something would have passed, in life, between
us; if nothing had passed one of us would have
moved. The moment was so prolonged that it
would have taken but little more to make me
doubt if even <em>I</em> were in life. I can’t express what
followed it save by saying that the silence itself&mdash;which
was indeed in a manner an attestation
of my strength&mdash;became the element into which
I saw the figure disappear; in which I definitely
saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch
to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of
an order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous
back that no hunch could have more disfigured,
straight down the staircase and into the
darkness in which the next bend was lost.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>X</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">I remained</span> awhile at the top of the stair, but
with the effect presently of understanding that
when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I
returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw
there by the light of the candle I had left burning
was that Flora’s little bed was empty; and on
this I caught my breath with all the terror that,
five minutes before, I had been able to resist. I
dashed at the place in which I had left her lying
and over which (for the small silk counterpane
and the sheets were disarranged) the white curtains
had been deceivingly pulled forward; then
my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an
answering sound: I perceived an agitation of
the window-blind, and the child, ducking down,
emerged rosily from the other side of it. She
stood there in so much of her candour and so
little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet
and the golden glow of her curls. She looked
intensely grave, and I had never had such a sense
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>
of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of
which had just been so prodigious) as on my
consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach.
“You naughty: where <em>have</em> you been?”&mdash;instead
of challenging her own irregularity I
found myself arraigned and explaining. She herself
explained, for that matter, with the loveliest,
eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as
she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had
jumped up to see what had become of me. I had
dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back
into my chair&mdash;feeling then, and then only, a
little faint; and she had pattered straight over to
me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself
to be held with the flame of the candle full in the
wonderful little face that was still flushed with
sleep. I remember closing my eyes an instant,
yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of
something beautiful that shone out of the blue of
her own. “You were looking for me out of the
window?” I said. “You thought I might be
walking in the grounds?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I thought someone was”&mdash;she
never blanched as she smiled out that at me.</p>

<p>Oh, how I looked at her now! “And did you
see anyone?”</p>

<p>“Ah, <em>no</em>!” she returned, almost with the full
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
privilege of childish inconsequence, resentfully,
though with a long sweetness in her little drawl
of the negative.</p>

<p>At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I
absolutely believed she lied; and if I once more
closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the
three or four possible ways in which I might take
this up. One of these, for a moment, tempted
me with such singular intensity that, to withstand
it, I must have gripped my little girl with
a spasm that, wonderfully, she submitted to
without a cry or a sign of fright. Why not
break out at her on the spot and have it all over?&mdash;give
it to her straight in her lovely little
lighted face? “You see, you see, you <em>know</em> that
you do and that you already quite suspect I
believe it; therefore why not frankly confess
it to me, so that we may at least live with it
together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness
of our fate, where we are and what it means?”
This solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I
could immediately have succumbed to it I might
have spared myself<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>well you’ll see what.
Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet,
looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle
way. “Why did you pull the curtain over the
place to make me think you were still there?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>Flora luminously considered; after which,
with her little divine smile: “Because I don’t
like to frighten you!”</p>

<p>“But if I had, by your idea, gone out<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she
turned her eyes to the flame of the candle as if
the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate
as impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine.
“Oh, but you know,” she quite adequately answered,
“that you might come back, you dear,
and that you <em>have</em>!” And after a little, when
she had got into bed, I had, for a long time, by
almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to
prove that I recognised the pertinence of my
return.</p>

<p>You may imagine the general complexion,
from that moment, of my nights. I repeatedly
sat up till I didn’t know when; I selected moments
when my room-mate unmistakeably slept,
and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the
passage and even pushed as far as to where I
had last met Quint. But I never met him
there again; and I may as well say at once that
I on no other occasion saw him in the house.
I just missed, on the staircase, on the other
hand, a different adventure. Looking down it
from the top I once recognised the presence of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
a woman seated on one of the lower steps with
her back presented to me, her body half bowed
and her head, in an attitude of woe, in her
hands. I had been there but an instant, however,
when she vanished without looking round
at me. I knew, none the less, exactly what
dreadful face she had to show; and I wondered
whether, if instead of being above I had been
below, I should have had, for going up, the
same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well,
there continued to be plenty of chance for
nerve. On the eleventh night after my latest
encounter with that gentleman&mdash;they were all
numbered now&mdash;I had an alarm that perilously
skirted it and that indeed, from the particular
quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my
sharpest shock. It was precisely the first
night during this series that, weary with watching,
I had felt that I might again without laxity
lay myself down at my old hour. I slept immediately
and, as I afterwards knew, till about
one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit
straight up, as completely roused as if a hand
had shook me. I had left a light burning, but
it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty
that Flora had extinguished it. This brought
me to my feet and straight, in the darkness,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
to her bed, which I found she had left. A
glance at the window enlightened me further,
and the striking of a match completed the
picture.</p>

<p>The child had again got up&mdash;this time blowing
out the taper, and had again, for some purpose
of observation or response, squeezed in
behind the blind and was peering out into the
night. That she now saw&mdash;as she had not, I
had satisfied myself, the previous time&mdash;was
proved to me by the fact that she was disturbed
neither by my re-illumination nor by the
haste I made to get into slippers and into a
wrap. Hidden, protected, absorbed, she evidently
rested on the sill&mdash;the casement opened
forward&mdash;and gave herself up. There was a
great still moon to help her, and this fact had
counted in my quick decision. She was face
to face with the apparition we had met at the
lake, and could now communicate with it as
she had not then been able to do. What I, on
my side, had to care for was, without disturbing
her, to reach, from the corridor, some other
window in the same quarter. I got to the door
without her hearing me; I got out of it, closed
it and listened, from the other side, for some
sound from her. While I stood in the passage
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>
I had my eyes on her brother’s door, which
was but ten steps off and which, indescribably,
produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse
that I lately spoke of as my temptation.
What if I should go straight in and march to
<em>his</em> window?&mdash;what if, by risking to his boyish
bewilderment a revelation of my motive, I
should throw across the rest of the mystery the
long halter of my boldness?</p>

<p>This thought held me sufficiently to make me
cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally
listened; I figured to myself what
might portentously be; I wondered if his bed
were also empty and he too were secretly at
watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the
end of which my impulse failed. He was quiet;
he might be innocent; the risk was hideous; I
turned away. There was a figure in the grounds&mdash;a
figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with
whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the
visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated
afresh, but on other grounds and only a few
seconds; then I had made my choice. There
were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a
question of choosing the right one. The right
one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower
one&mdash;though high above the gardens&mdash;in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as
the old tower. This was a large, square chamber,
arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant
size of which made it so inconvenient
that it had not for years, though kept by Mrs.
Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had
often admired it and I knew my way about in it;
I had only, after just faltering at the first chill
gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt
as quietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving
this transit, I uncovered the glass without a
sound and, applying my face to the pane, was
able, the darkness without being much less than
within, to see that I commanded the right direction.
Then I saw something more. The moon
made the night extraordinarily penetrable and
showed me on the lawn a person, diminished by
distance, who stood there motionless and as if
fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared&mdash;looking,
that is, not so much straight at me as at
something that was apparently above me. There
was clearly another person above me&mdash;there was
a person on the tower; but the presence on the
lawn was not in the least what I had conceived
and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence
on the lawn&mdash;I felt sick as I made it out&mdash;was
poor little Miles himself.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">It</span> was not till late next day that I spoke to
Mrs. Grose; the rigour with which I kept my
pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet
her privately, and the more as we each felt the
importance of not provoking&mdash;on the part of
the servants quite as much as on that of the
children&mdash;any suspicion of a secret flurry or
of a discussion of mysteries. I drew a great
security in this particular from her mere smooth
aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face
to pass on to others my horrible confidences.
She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if she
hadn’t I don’t know what would have become
of me, for I couldn’t have borne the business
alone. But she was a magnificent monument
to the blessing of a want of imagination, and
if she could see in our little charges nothing
but their beauty and amiability, their happiness
and cleverness, she had no direct communication
with the sources of my trouble. If they had
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
been at all visibly blighted or battered, she
would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back,
haggard enough to match them; as matters
stood, however, I could feel her, when she
surveyed them, with her large white arms folded
and the habit of serenity in all her look, thank
the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the
pieces would still serve. Flights of fancy gave
place, in her mind, to a steady fireside glow,
and I had already begun to perceive how, with
the development of the conviction that&mdash;as
time went on without a public accident&mdash;our
young things could, after all, look out for
themselves, she addressed her greatest solicitude
to the sad case presented by their instructress.
That, for myself, was a sound simplification:
I could engage that, to the world, my face
should tell no tales, but it would have been,
in the conditions, an immense added strain to
find myself anxious about hers.</p>

<p>At the hour I now speak of she had joined
me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with
the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was
now agreeable; and we sat there together while,
before us, at a distance, but within call if we
wished, the children strolled to and fro in one
of their most manageable moods. They moved
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>
slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the
boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook
and passing his arm round his sister to
keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose watched
them with positive placidity; then I caught
the suppressed intellectual creak with which
she conscientiously turned to take from me a
view of the back of the tapestry. I had made
her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was
an odd recognition of my superiority&mdash;my
accomplishments and my function&mdash;in her patience
under my pain. She offered her mind
to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a
witch’s broth and proposed it with assurance,
she would have held out a large clean saucepan.
This had become thoroughly her attitude by
the time that, in my recital of the events of the
night, I reached the point of what Miles had
said to me when, after seeing him, at such a
monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where
he happened now to be, I had gone down to
bring him in; choosing then, at the window,
with a concentrated need of not alarming the
house, rather that method than a signal more
resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little
doubt of my small hope of representing with
success even to her actual sympathy my sense
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
of the real splendour of the little inspiration
with which, after I had got him into the house,
the boy met my final articulate challenge. As
soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the
terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible;
on which I had taken his hand without a
word and led him, through the dark spaces, up
the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered
for him, along the lobby where I had
listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken
room.</p>

<p>Not a sound, on the way, had passed between
us, and I had wondered&mdash;oh, <em>how</em> I had wondered!&mdash;if
he were groping about in his little
mind for something plausible and not too grotesque.
It would tax his invention, certainly,
and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment,
a curious thrill of triumph. It was a
sharp trap for the inscrutable! He couldn’t
play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce
would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed,
with the passionate throb of this question,
an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce <em>I</em>
should. I was confronted at last, as never yet,
with all the risk attached even now to sounding
my own horrid note. I remember in fact that
as we pushed into his little chamber, where the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
bed had not been slept in at all and the window,
uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so
clear that there was no need of striking a match&mdash;I
remember how I suddenly dropped, sank
upon the edge of the bed from the force of the
idea that he must know how he really, as they
say, “had” me. He could do what he liked,
with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I
should continue to defer to the old tradition of
the criminality of those caretakers of the young
who minister to superstitions and fears. He
“had” me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who
would ever absolve me, who would consent that
I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor
of an overture, I were the first to introduce
into our perfect intercourse an element so dire?
No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to
Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to
attempt to suggest here, how, in our short,
stiff brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with
admiration. I was of course thoroughly kind
and merciful; never, never yet had I placed on
his little shoulders hands of such tenderness
as those with which, while I rested against
the bed, I held him there well under fire. I had
no alternative but, in form at least, to put it to
him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>“You must tell me now&mdash;and all the truth.
What did you go out for? What were you
doing there?”</p>

<p>I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites
of his beautiful eyes, and the uncovering of his
little teeth shine to me in the dusk. “If I tell
you why, will you understand?” My heart, at
this, leaped into my mouth. <em>Would</em> he tell me
why? I found no sound on my lips to press it,
and I was aware of replying only with a vague,
repeated, grimacing nod. He was gentleness
itself, and while I wagged my head at him he
stood there more than ever a little fairy prince.
It was his brightness indeed that gave me a
respite. Would it be so great if he were really
going to tell me? “Well,” he said at last, “just
exactly in order that you should do this.”</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p>“Think me&mdash;for a change&mdash;<em>bad</em>!” I shall
never forget the sweetness and gaiety with
which he brought out the word, nor how, on
top of it, he bent forward and kissed me. It
was practically the end of everything. I met
his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him
for a minute in my arms, the most stupendous
effort not to cry. He had given exactly the
account of himself that permitted least of my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
going behind it, and it was only with the effect
of confirming my acceptance of it that, as I
presently glanced about the room, I could say&mdash;</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t undress at all?”</p>

<p>He fairly glittered in the gloom. “Not at
all. I sat up and read.”</p>

<p>“And when did you go down?”</p>

<p>“At midnight. When I’m bad I <em>am</em> bad!”</p>

<p>“I see, I see&mdash;it’s charming. But how could
you be sure I would know it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I arranged that with Flora.” His
answers rang out with a readiness! “She was
to get up and look out.”</p>

<p>“Which is what she did do.” It was I who
fell into the trap!</p>

<p>“So she disturbed you, and, to see what she
was looking at, you also looked&mdash;you saw.”</p>

<p>“While you,” I concurred, “caught your
death in the night air!”</p>

<p>He literally bloomed so from this exploit that
he could afford radiantly to assent. “How
otherwise should I have been bad enough?” he
asked. Then, after another embrace, the incident
and our interview closed on my recognition
of all the reserves of goodness that, for
his joke, he had been able to draw upon.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>XII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> particular impression I had received proved
in the morning light, I repeat, not quite successfully
presentable to Mrs. Grose, though I reinforced
it with the mention of still another remark
that he had made before we separated. “It all
lies in half-a-dozen words,” I said to her, “words
that really settle the matter. ‘Think, you know,
what I <em>might</em> do!’ He threw that off to show
me how good he is. He knows down to the
ground what he ‘might’ do. That’s what he
gave them a taste of at school.”</p>

<p>“Lord, you do change!” cried my friend.</p>

<p>“I don’t change&mdash;I simply make it out. The
four, depend upon it, perpetually meet. If on
either of these last nights you had been with
either child, you would clearly have understood.
The more I’ve watched and waited the more I’ve
felt that if there were nothing else to make it sure
it would be made so by the systematic silence
of each. <em>Never</em>, by a slip of the tongue, have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
they so much as alluded to either of their old
friends, any more than Miles has alluded to his
expulsion. Oh yes, we may sit here and look at
them, and they may show off to us there to their
fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in
their fairy-tale they’re steeped in their vision of
the dead restored. He’s not reading to her,”
I declared; “they’re talking of <em>them</em>&mdash;they’re
talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were
crazy; and it’s a wonder I’m not. What I’ve
seen would have made <em>you</em> so; but it has only
made me more lucid, made me get hold of still
other things.”</p>

<p>My lucidity must have seemed awful, but the
charming creatures who were victims of it, passing
and repassing in their interlocked sweetness,
gave my colleague something to hold on by;
and I felt how tight she held as, without stirring
in the breath of my passion, she covered them
still with her eyes. “Of what other things have
you got hold?”</p>

<p>“Why, of the very things that have delighted,
fascinated, and yet, at bottom, as I now
so strangely see, mystified and troubled me.
Their more than earthly beauty, their absolutely
unnatural goodness. It’s a game,” I went on;
“it’s a policy and a fraud!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>“On the part of little darlings<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“As yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as
that seems!” The very act of bringing it out
really helped me to trace it&mdash;follow it all up
and piece it all together. “They haven’t been
good&mdash;they’ve only been absent. It has been
easy to live with them, because they’re simply
leading a life of their own. They’re not mine&mdash;they’re
not ours. They’re his and they’re
hers!”</p>

<p>“Quint’s and that woman’s?”</p>

<p>“Quint’s and that woman’s. They want to
get to them.”</p>

<p>Oh, how, at this, poor Mrs. Grose appeared to
study them! “But for what?”</p>

<p>“For the love of all the evil that, in those
dreadful days, the pair put into them. And to
ply them with that evil still, to keep up the work
of demons, is what brings the others back.”</p>

<p>“Laws!” said my friend under her breath.
The exclamation was homely, but it revealed a
real acceptance of my further proof of what, in
the bad time&mdash;for there had been a worse even
than this!&mdash;must have occurred. There could
have been no such justification for me as the
plain assent of her experience to whatever depth
of depravity I found credible in our brace of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
scoundrels. It was in obvious submission of
memory that she brought out after a moment:
“They <em>were</em> rascals! But what can they now
do?” she pursued.</p>

<p>“Do?” I echoed so loud that Miles and Flora,
as they passed at their distance, paused an instant
in their walk and looked at us. “Don’t
they do enough?” I demanded in a lower tone,
while the children, having smiled and nodded
and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition.
We were held by it a minute; then I
answered: “They can destroy them!” At this
my companion did turn, but the inquiry she
launched was a silent one, the effect of which
was to make me more explicit. “They don’t
know, as yet, quite how&mdash;but they’re trying
hard. They’re seen only across, as it were, and
beyond&mdash;in strange places and on high places,
the top of towers, the roof of houses, the outside
of windows, the further edge of pools; but
there’s a deep design, on either side, to shorten
the distance and overcome the obstacle; and the
success of the tempters is only a question of
time. They’ve only to keep to their suggestions
of danger.”</p>

<p>“For the children to come?”</p>

<p>“And perish in the attempt!” Mrs. Grose
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
slowly got up, and I scrupulously added: “Unless,
of course, we can prevent!”</p>

<p>Standing there before me while I kept my
seat, she visibly turned things over. “Their
uncle must do the preventing. He must take
them away.”</p>

<p>“And who’s to make him?”</p>

<p>She had been scanning the distance, but she
now dropped on me a foolish face. “You,
Miss.”</p>

<p>“By writing to him that his house is poisoned
and his little nephew and niece mad?”</p>

<p>“But if they <em>are</em>, Miss?”</p>

<p>“And if I am myself, you mean? That’s
charming news to be sent him by a governess
whose prime undertaking was to give him no
worry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose considered, following the children
again. “Yes, he do hate worry. That was the
great reason<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Why those fiends took him in so long? No
doubt, though his indifference must have been
awful. As I’m not a fiend, at any rate, I
shouldn’t take him in.”</p>

<p>My companion, after an instant and for all
answer, sat down again and grasped my arm.
“Make him at any rate come to you.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>I stared. “To <em>me</em>?” I had a sudden fear of
what she might do. “‘Him’?”</p>

<p>“He ought to <em>be</em> here&mdash;he ought to help.”</p>

<p>I quickly rose, and I think I must have
shown her a queerer face than ever yet. “You
see me asking him for a visit?” No, with her
eyes on my face she evidently couldn’t. Instead
of it even&mdash;as a woman reads another&mdash;she
could see what I myself saw: his derision, his
amusement, his contempt for the break-down of
my resignation at being left alone and for the
fine machinery I had set in motion to attract his
attention to my slighted charms. She didn’t
know&mdash;no one knew&mdash;how proud I had been
to serve him and to stick to our terms; yet
she none the less took the measure, I think, of
the warning I now gave her. “If you should
so lose your head as to appeal to him for
me<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>She was really frightened. “Yes, Miss?”</p>

<p>“I would leave, on the spot, both him and
you.”</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">It</span> was all very well to join them, but speaking
to them proved quite as much as ever an
effort beyond my strength&mdash;offered, in close
quarters, difficulties as insurmountable as before.
This situation continued a month, and with new
aggravations and particular notes, the note above
all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness
on the part of my pupils. It was
not, I am as sure today as I was sure then,
my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely
traceable that they were aware of my predicament
and that this strange relation made, in
a manner, for a long time, the air in which
we moved. I don’t mean that they had their
tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar,
for that was not one of their dangers: I do
mean, on the other hand, that the element of
the unnamed and untouched became, between
us, greater than any other, and that so much
avoidance could not have been so successfully
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement.
It was as if, at moments, we were perpetually
coming into sight of subjects before
which we must stop short, turning suddenly out
of alleys that we perceived to be blind, closing
with a little bang that made us look at each
other&mdash;for, like all bangs, it was something
louder than we had intended&mdash;the doors we
had indiscreetly opened. All roads lead to
Rome, and there were times when it might have
struck us that almost every branch of study or
subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground.
Forbidden ground was the question of the return
of the dead in general and of whatever, in
especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends
little children had lost. There were days when
I could have sworn that one of them had, with
a small invisible nudge, said to the other: “She
thinks she’ll do it this time&mdash;but she <em>won’t</em>!”
To “do it” would have been to indulge for
instance&mdash;and for once in a way&mdash;in some direct
reference to the lady who had prepared them for
my discipline. They had a delightful endless
appetite for passages in my own history, to which
I had again and again treated them; they were
in possession of everything that had ever happened
to me, had had, with every circumstance
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
the story of my smallest adventures and of those
of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the
dog at home, as well as many particulars of the
eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture
and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation
of the old women of our village. There
were things enough, taking one with another, to
chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by
instinct when to go round. They pulled with
an art of their own the strings of my invention
and my memory; and nothing else perhaps, when
I thought of such occasions afterwards, gave me
so the suspicion of being watched from under
cover. It was in any case over <em>my</em> life, <em>my</em> past,
and <em>my</em> friends alone that we could take anything
like our ease&mdash;a state of affairs that led
them sometimes without the least pertinence to
break out into sociable reminders. I was invited&mdash;with
no visible connection&mdash;to repeat afresh
Goody Gosling’s celebrated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot</i> or to confirm the
details already supplied as to the cleverness of
the vicarage pony.</p>

<p>It was partly at such junctures as these and
partly at quite different ones that, with the
turn my matters had now taken, my predicament,
as I have called it, grew most sensible.
The fact that the days passed for me without
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
another encounter ought, it would have appeared,
to have done something toward soothing
my nerves. Since the light brush, that
second night on the upper landing, of the presence
of a woman at the foot of the stair, I had
seen nothing, whether in or out of the house,
that one had better not have seen. There was
many a corner round which I expected to come
upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a
merely sinister way, would have favoured the
appearance of Miss Jessel. The summer had
turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had
dropped upon Bly and had blown out half our
lights. The place, with its grey sky and withered
garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead
leaves, was like a theatre after the performance&mdash;all
strewn with crumpled playbills. There
were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound
and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of the
<em>kind</em> of ministering moment, that brought back
to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling of the
medium in which, that June evening out-of-doors,
I had had my first sight of Quint, and in which,
too, at those other instants, I had, after seeing
him through the window, looked for him in vain
in the circle of shrubbery. I recognised the
signs, the portents&mdash;I recognised the moment,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
the spot. But they remained unaccompanied and
empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested
one could call a young woman whose sensibility
had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not
declined but deepened. I had said in my talk
with Mrs. Grose on that horrid scene of Flora’s
by the lake&mdash;and had perplexed her by so saying&mdash;that
it would from that moment distress
me much more to lose my power than to keep it.
I had then expressed what was vividly in my
mind: the truth that, whether the children really
saw or not&mdash;since, that is, it was not yet definitely
proved&mdash;I greatly preferred, as a safeguard,
the fulness of my own exposure. I was
ready to know the very worst that was to be
known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse
of was that my eyes might be sealed just while
theirs were most opened. Well, my eyes <em>were</em>
sealed, it appeared, at present&mdash;a consummation
for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank
God. There was, alas, a difficulty about that:
I would have thanked him with all my soul had
I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction
of the secret of my pupils.</p>

<p>How can I retrace today the strange steps of
my obsession? There were times of our being
together when I would have been ready to swear
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct
sense of it closed, they had visitors who were
known and were welcome. Then it was that,
had I not been deterred by the very chance that
such an injury might prove greater than the
injury to be averted, my exultation would have
broken out. “They’re here, they’re here, you
little wretches,” I would have cried, “and you
can’t deny it now!” The little wretches denied
it with all the added volume of their sociability
and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths
of which&mdash;like the flash of a fish in a stream&mdash;the
mockery of their advantage peeped up. The
shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper
than I knew on the night when, looking out to
see either Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars,
I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched
and who had immediately brought in with him&mdash;had
straightway, there, turned it on me&mdash;the
lovely upward look with which, from the battlements
above me, the hideous apparition of Quint
had played. If it was a question of a scare, my
discovery on this occasion had scared me more
than any other, and it was in the condition of
nerves produced by it that I made my actual
inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes,
at odd moments, I shut myself up audibly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
to rehearse&mdash;it was at once a fantastic relief
and a renewed despair&mdash;the manner in which I
might come to the point. I approached it from
one side and the other while, in my room, I flung
myself about, but I always broke down in the
monstrous utterance of names. As they died
away on my lips, I said to myself that I should
indeed help them to represent something infamous
if, by pronouncing them, I should violate
as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any
schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When
I said to myself: “<em>They</em> have the manners to be
silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness
to speak!” I felt myself crimson and I covered
my face with my hands. After these secret
scenes I chattered more than ever, going on
volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable
hushes occurred&mdash;I can call them nothing
else&mdash;the strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try
for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life,
that had nothing to do with the more or less
noise that at the moment we might be engaged
in making and that I could hear through any
deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation
or louder strum of the piano. Then it was that
the others, the outsiders, were there. Though
they were not angels, they “passed,” as the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
French, say, causing me, while they stayed, to
tremble with the fear of their addressing to
their younger victims some yet more infernal
message or more vivid image than they had
thought good enough for myself.</p>

<p>What it was most impossible to get rid of was
the cruel idea that, whatever I had seen, Miles
and Flora saw <em>more</em>&mdash;things terrible and unguessable
and that sprang from dreadful passages
of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally
left on the surface, for the time, a chill which
we vociferously denied that we felt; and we
had, all three, with repetition, got into such
splendid training that we went, each time, almost
automatically, to mark the close of the incident,
through the very same movements. It was striking
of the children, at all events, to kiss me
inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and
never to fail&mdash;one or the other&mdash;of the precious
question that had helped us through many a
peril. “When do you think he <em>will</em> come?
Don’t you think we <em>ought</em> to write?”&mdash;there
was nothing like that inquiry, we found by
experience, for carrying off an awkwardness.
“He” of course was their uncle in Harley Street;
and we lived in much profusion of theory that
he might at any moment arrive to mingle in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
our circle. It was impossible to have given
less encouragement than he had done to such
a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine
to fall back upon we should have deprived each
other of some of our finest exhibitions. He
never wrote to them&mdash;that may have been
selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of his
trust of me; for the way in which a man pays
his highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but
by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred
laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried
out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal
to him when I let my charges understand that
their own letters were but charming literary
exercises. They were too beautiful to be posted;
I kept them myself; I have them all to this
hour. This was a rule indeed which only added
to the satiric effect of my being plied with the
supposition that he might at any moment be
among us. It was exactly as if my charges
knew how almost more awkward than anything
else that might be for me. There appears to
me, moreover, as I look back, no note in all
this more extraordinary than the mere fact that,
in spite of my tension and of their triumph, I
never lost patience with them. Adorable they
must in truth have been, I now reflect, that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
I didn’t in these days hate them! Would exasperation,
however, if relief had longer been
postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little
matters, for relief arrived. I call it relief, though
it was only the relief that a snap brings to a
strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day
of suffocation. It was at least change, and it
came with a rush.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">Walking</span> to church a certain Sunday morning,
I had little Miles at my side and his sister, in
advance of us and at Mrs. Grose’s, well in sight.
It was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for
some time; the night had brought a touch of
frost, and the autumn air, bright and sharp, made
the church-bells almost gay. It was an odd
accident of thought that I should have happened
at such a moment to be particularly and very
gratefully struck with the obedience of my little
charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable,
my perpetual society? Something or other
had brought nearer home to me that I had all
but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, in the
way our companions were marshalled before me,
I might have appeared to provide against some
danger of rebellion. I was like a gaoler with an
eye to possible surprises and escapes. But all
this belonged&mdash;I mean their magnificent little
surrender&mdash;just to the special array of the facts
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
that were most abysmal. Turned out for Sunday
by his uncle’s tailor, who had had a free hand and
a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand
little air, Miles’s whole title to independence, the
rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped
upon him that if he had suddenly struck for
freedom I should have had nothing to say. I
was by the strangest of chances wondering how
I should meet him when the revolution unmistakeably
occurred. I call it a revolution because I
now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain
rose on the last act of my dreadful drama and the
catastrophe was precipitated. “Look here, my
dear, you know,” he charmingly said, “when in
the world, please, am I going back to school?”</p>

<p>Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless
enough, particularly as uttered in the sweet, high,
casual pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but
above all at his eternal governess, he threw off
intonations as if he were tossing roses. There
was something in them that always made one
“catch” and I caught, at any rate, now so
effectually that I stopped as short as if one of
the trees of the park had fallen across the road.
There was something new, on the spot, between
us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognised
it, though, to enable me to do so, he had no need
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>
to look a whit less candid and charming than
usual. I could feel in him how he already, from
my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the
advantage he had gained. I was so slow to find
anything that he had plenty of time, after a
minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive
smile: “You know, my dear, that for
a fellow to be with a lady <em>always</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” His
“my dear” was constantly on his lips for me,
and nothing could have expressed more the exact
shade of the sentiment with which I desired to
inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity. It
was so respectfully easy.</p>

<p>But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick
my own phrases! I remember that, to gain time,
I tried to laugh, and I seemed to see in the beautiful
face with which he watched me how ugly
and queer I looked. “And always with the
same lady?” I returned.</p>

<p>He neither blenched nor winked. The whole
thing was virtually out between us. “Ah, of
course, she’s a jolly, ‘perfect’ lady; but, after
all, I’m a fellow, don’t you see? that’s&mdash;well,
getting on.”</p>

<p>I lingered there with him an instant ever so
kindly. “Yes, you’re getting on.” Oh, but I
felt helpless!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>I have kept to this day the heartbreaking little
idea of how he seemed to know that and to play
with it. “And you can’t say I’ve not been awfully
good, can you?”</p>

<p>I laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I
felt how much better it would have been to walk
on, I was not yet quite able. “No, I can’t say
that, Miles.”</p>

<p>“Except just that one night, you know<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“That one night?” I couldn’t look as straight
as he.</p>

<p>“Why, when I went down&mdash;went out of the
house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.”</p>

<p>“You forget?”&mdash;he spoke with the sweet extravagance
of childish reproach. “Why, it was
to show you I could!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you could.”</p>

<p>“And I can again.”</p>

<p>I felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed
in keeping my wits about me. “Certainly. But
you won’t.”</p>

<p>“No, not <em>that</em> again. It was nothing.”</p>

<p>“It was nothing,” I said. “But we must
go on.”</p>

<p>He resumed our walk with me, passing his hand
into my arm. “Then when <em>am</em> I going back?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible
air. “Were you very happy at school?”</p>

<p>He just considered. “Oh, I’m happy enough
anywhere!”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” I quavered, “if you’re just as
happy here<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that isn’t everything! Of course
<em>you</em> know a lot<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“But you hint that you know almost as
much?” I risked as he paused.</p>

<p>“Not half I want to!” Miles honestly professed.
“But it isn’t so much that.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I want to see more life.”</p>

<p>“I see; I see.” We had arrived within sight
of the church and of various persons, including
several of the household of Bly, on their way to
it and clustered about the door to see us go in.
I quickened our step; I wanted to get there
before the question between us opened up much
further; I reflected hungrily that, for more
than an hour, he would have to be silent; and
I thought with envy of the comparative dusk of
the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the
hassock on which I might bend my knees. I
seemed literally to be running a race with some
confusion to which he was about to reduce me,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
but I felt that he had got in first when, before we
had even entered the churchyard, he threw out&mdash;</p>

<p>“I want my own sort!”</p>

<p>It literally made me bound forward. “There
are not many of your own sort, Miles!” I
laughed. “Unless perhaps dear little Flora!”</p>

<p>“You really compare me to a baby girl?”</p>

<p>This found me singularly weak. “Don’t you,
then, <em>love</em> our sweet Flora?”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t&mdash;and you too; if I didn’t<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”
he repeated as if retreating for a jump, yet leaving
his thought so unfinished that, after we had
come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed
on me by the pressure of his arm, had
become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had
passed into the church, the other worshippers
had followed, and we were, for the minute, alone
among the old, thick graves. We had paused, on
the path from the gate, by a low, oblong, tablelike
tomb.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you didn’t<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>He looked, while I waited, about at the graves.
“Well, you know what!” But he didn’t move,
and he presently produced something that made
me drop straight down on the stone slab, as if
suddenly to rest. “Does my uncle think what
<em>you</em> think?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>I markedly rested. “How do you know what
I think?”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, of course I don’t; for it strikes me
you never tell me. But I mean does <em>he</em> know?”</p>

<p>“Know what, Miles?”</p>

<p>“Why, the way I’m going on.”</p>

<p>I perceived quickly enough that I could make,
to this inquiry, no answer that would not involve
something of a sacrifice of my employer. Yet it
appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently
sacrificed to make that venial. “I don’t
think your uncle much cares.”</p>

<p>Miles, on this, stood looking at me. “Then
don’t you think he can be made to?”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Why, by his coming down.”</p>

<p>“But who’ll get him to come down?”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> will!” the boy said with extraordinary
brightness and emphasis. He gave me another
look charged with that expression and then
marched off alone into church.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>XV</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> business was practically settled from the
moment I never followed him. It was a pitiful
surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this
had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat
there on my tomb and read into what my little
friend had said to me the fulness of its meaning;
by the time I had grasped the whole of which I
had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I
was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest of
the congregation such an example of delay. What
I said to myself above all was that Miles had got
something out of me and that the proof of it, for
him, would be just this awkward collapse. He
had got out of me that there was something I was
much afraid of and that he should probably be
able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own
purpose, more freedom. My fear was of having
to deal with the intolerable question of the
grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was
really but the question of the horrors gathered
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
behind. That his uncle should arrive to treat
with me of these things was a solution that,
strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to
bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness
and the pain of it that I simply procrastinated
and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to my
deep discomposure, was immensely in the right,
was in a position to say to me: “Either you clear
up with my guardian the mystery of this interruption
of my studies, or you cease to expect me
to lead with you a life that’s so unnatural for a
boy.” What was so unnatural for the particular
boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation
of a consciousness and a plan.</p>

<p>That was what really overcame me, what prevented
my going in. I walked round the church,
hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had already,
with him, hurt myself beyond repair.
Therefore I could patch up nothing, and it was
too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into
the pew: he would be so much more sure than
ever to pass his arm into mine and make me sit
there for an hour in close, silent contact with his
commentary on our talk. For the first minute
since his arrival I wanted to get away from him.
As I paused beneath the high east window and
listened to the sounds of worship, I was taken
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
with an impulse that might master me, I felt,
completely should I give it the least encouragement.
I might easily put an end to my predicament
by getting away altogether. Here was my
chance; there was no one to stop me; I could
give the whole thing up&mdash;turn my back and
retreat. It was only a question of hurrying
again, for a few preparations, to the house which
the attendance at church of so many of the servants
would practically have left unoccupied.
No one, in short, could blame me if I should just
drive desperately off. What was it to get away
if I got away only till dinner? That would be in
a couple of hours, at the end of which&mdash;I had the
acute prevision&mdash;my little pupils would play at
innocent wonder about my non-appearance in
their train.</p>

<p>“What <em>did</em> you do, you naughty, bad thing?
Why in the world, to worry us so&mdash;and take our
thoughts off too, don’t you know?&mdash;did you
desert us at the very door?” I couldn’t meet
such questions nor, as they asked them, their
false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly
what I should have to meet that, as the prospect
grew sharp to me, I at last let myself go.</p>

<p>I got, so far as the immediate moment was
concerned, away; I came straight out of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>
churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps
through the park. It seemed to me that by the
time I reached the house I had made up my mind
I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the
approaches and of the interior, in which I met no
one, fairly excited me with a sense of opportunity.
Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get
off without a scene, without a word. My quickness
would have to be remarkable, however, and
the question of a conveyance was the great one to
settle. Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties
and obstacles, I remember sinking down at the
foot of the staircase&mdash;suddenly collapsing there
on the lowest step and then, with a revulsion,
recalling that it was exactly where more than a
month before, in the darkness of night and just
so bowed with evil things, I had seen the spectre
of the most horrible of women. At this I was
able to straighten myself; I went the rest of the
way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the
schoolroom, where there were objects belonging
to me that I should have to take. But I opened
the door to find again, in a flash, my eyes unsealed.
In the presence of what I saw I reeled
straight back upon my resistance.</p>

<p>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light
I saw a person whom, without my previous experience,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
I should have taken at the first blush
for some housemaid who might have stayed at
home to look after the place and who, availing
herself of rare relief from observation and of the
schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had
applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter
to her sweetheart. There was an effort in the
way that, while her arms rested on the table, her
hands with evident weariness supported her
head; but at the moment I took this in I had
already become aware that, in spite of my entrance,
her attitude strangely persisted. Then it
was&mdash;with the very act of its announcing itself&mdash;that
her identity flared up in a change of
posture. She rose, not as if she had heard me,
but with an indescribable grand melancholy of
indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen
feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor.
Dishonoured and tragic, she was all before me;
but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it,
the awful image passed away. Dark as midnight
in her black dress, her haggard beauty and her
unutterable woe, she had looked at me long
enough to appear to say that her right to sit at
my table was as good as mine to sit at hers.
While these instants lasted indeed I had the
extraordinary chill of a feeling that it was I who
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
was the intruder. It was as a wild protest
against it that, actually addressing her&mdash;“You
terrible, miserable woman!”&mdash;I heard myself
break into a sound that, by the open door, rang
through the long passage and the empty house.
She looked at me as if she heard me, but I had
recovered myself and cleared the air. There was
nothing in the room the next minute but the
sunshine and a sense that I must stay.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>XVI</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">I had</span> so perfectly expected that the return
of my pupils would be marked by a demonstration
that I was freshly upset at having to take
into account that they were dumb about my
absence. Instead of gaily denouncing and caressing
me, they made no allusion to my having
failed them, and I was left, for the time, on
perceiving that she too said nothing, to study
Mrs. Grose’s odd face. I did this to such purpose
that I made sure they had in some way
bribed her to silence; a silence that, however,
I would engage to break down on the first
private opportunity. This opportunity came
before tea: I secured five minutes with her in
the housekeeper’s room, where, in the twilight,
amid a smell of lately-baked bread, but with
the place all swept and garnished, I found her
sitting in pained placidity before the fire. So
I see her still, so I see her best: facing the
flame from her straight chair in the dusky,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
shining room, a large clean image of the “put
away”&mdash;of drawers closed and locked and rest
without a remedy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and
to please them&mdash;so long as they were there&mdash;of
course I promised. But what had happened
to you?”</p>

<p>“I only went with you for the walk,” I said.
“I had then to come back to meet a friend.”</p>

<p>She showed her surprise. “A friend&mdash;<em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have a couple!” I laughed. “But
did the children give you a reason?”</p>

<p>“For not alluding to your leaving us? Yes;
they said you would like it better. Do you
like it better?”</p>

<p>My face had made her rueful. “No, I like
it worse!” But after an instant I added: “Did
they say why I should like it better?”</p>

<p>“No; Master Miles only said, ‘We must do
nothing but what she likes!’”</p>

<p>“I wish indeed he would! And what did
Flora say?”</p>

<p>“Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, ‘Oh,
of course, of course!’&mdash;and I said the same.”</p>

<p>I thought a moment. “You were too sweet
too&mdash;I can hear you all. But none the less,
between Miles and me, it’s now all out.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>“All out?” My companion stared. “But
what, Miss?”</p>

<p>“Everything. It doesn’t matter. I’ve made
up my mind. I came home, my dear,” I went
on, “for a talk with Miss Jessel.”</p>

<p>I had by this time formed the habit of having
Mrs. Grose literally well in hand in advance of
my sounding that note; so that even now, as
she bravely blinked under the signal of my
word, I could keep her comparatively firm. “A
talk! Do you mean she spoke?”</p>

<p>“It came to that. I found her, on my return,
in the schoolroom.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?” I can hear the
good woman still, and the candour of her
stupefaction.</p>

<p>“That she suffers the torments<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>It was this, of a truth, that made her, as she
filled out my picture, gape. “Do you mean,”
she faltered, “&mdash;of the lost?”</p>

<p>“Of the lost. Of the damned. And that’s
why, to share them<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” I faltered myself
with the horror of it.</p>

<p>But my companion, with less imagination, kept
me up. “To share them<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“She wants Flora.” Mrs. Grose might, as I
gave it to her, fairly have fallen away from me
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
had I not been prepared. I still held her there,
to show I was. “As I’ve told you, however, it
doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Because you’ve made up your mind? But
to what?”</p>

<p>“To everything.”</p>

<p>“And what do you call ‘everything’?”</p>

<p>“Why, sending for their uncle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss, in pity do,” my friend broke out.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I will, I <em>will</em>! I see it’s the only
way. What’s ‘out,’ as I told you, with Miles
is that if he thinks I’m afraid to&mdash;and has
ideas of what he gains by that&mdash;he shall see
he’s mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have
it here from me on the spot (and before the
boy himself if necessary) that if I’m to be
reproached with having done nothing again
about more school<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” my companion pressed me.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s that awful reason.”</p>

<p>There were now clearly so many of these for
my poor colleague that she was excusable for
being vague. “But&mdash;a&mdash;which?”</p>

<p>“Why, the letter from his old place.”</p>

<p>“You’ll show it to the master?”</p>

<p>“I ought to have done so on the instant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Mrs. Grose with decision.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>“I’ll put it before him,” I went on inexorably,
“that I can’t undertake to work the
question on behalf of a child who has been
expelled<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“For we’ve never in the least known what!”
Mrs. Grose declared.</p>

<p>“For wickedness. For what else&mdash;when
he’s so clever and beautiful and perfect? Is
he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is
he ill-natured? He’s exquisite&mdash;so it can be
only <em>that</em>; and that would open up the whole
thing. After all,” I said, “it’s their uncle’s
fault. If he left here such people<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“He didn’t really in the least know them.
The fault’s mine.” She had turned quite
pale.</p>

<p>“Well, you shan’t suffer,” I answered.</p>

<p>“The children shan’t!” she emphatically returned.</p>

<p>I was silent awhile; we looked at each other.
“Then what am I to tell him?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell him anything. <em>I’ll</em> tell
him.”</p>

<p>I measured this. “Do you mean you’ll
write<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” Remembering she couldn’t, I
caught myself up. “How do you communicate?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>“I tell the bailiff. <em>He</em> writes.”</p>

<p>“And should you like him to write our
story?”</p>

<p>My question had a sarcastic force that I had
not fully intended, and it made her, after a
moment, inconsequently break down. The tears
were again in her eyes. “Ah, Miss, <em>you</em>
write!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;tonight,” I at last answered; and
on this we separated.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>XVII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">I went</span> so far, in the evening, as to make a
beginning. The weather had changed back, a
great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp,
in my room, with Flora at peace beside me, I
sat for a long time before a blank sheet of paper
and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter
of the gusts. Finally I went out, taking a candle;
I crossed the passage and listened a minute
at Miles’s door. What, under my endless obsession,
I had been impelled to listen for was
some betrayal of his not being at rest, and I
presently caught one, but not in the form I had
expected. His voice tinkled out. “I say, you
there&mdash;come in.” It was a gaiety in the gloom!</p>

<p>I went in with my light and found him, in bed,
very wide awake, but very much at his ease.
“Well, what are <em>you</em> up to?” he asked with a
grace of sociability in which it occurred to me
that Mrs. Grose, had she been present, might
have looked in vain for proof that anything was
“out.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>I stood over him with my candle. “How did
you know I was there?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I heard you. Did you fancy
you made no noise? You’re like a troop of cavalry!”
he beautifully laughed.</p>

<p>“Then you weren’t asleep?”</p>

<p>“Not much! I lie awake and think.”</p>

<p>I had put my candle, designedly, a short way
off, and then, as he held out his friendly old hand
to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.
“What is it,” I asked, “that you think of?”</p>

<p>“What in the world, my dear, but <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“Ah, the pride I take in your appreciation
doesn’t insist on that! I had so far rather you
slept.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think also, you know, of this queer
business of ours.”</p>

<p>I marked the coolness of his firm little hand.
“Of what queer business, Miles?”</p>

<p>“Why, the way you bring me up. And all
the rest!”</p>

<p>I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from
my glimmering taper there was light enough to
show how he smiled up at me from his pillow.
“What do you mean by all the rest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know, you know!”</p>

<p>I could say nothing for a minute, though I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
felt, as I held his hand and our eyes continued
to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting
his charge and that nothing in the whole
world of reality was perhaps at that moment so
fabulous as our actual relation. “Certainly you
shall go back to school,” I said, “if it be that
that troubles you. But not to the old place&mdash;we
must find another, a better. How could
I know it did trouble you, this question, when
you never told me so, never spoke of it at all?”
His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth
whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing
as some wistful patient in a children’s hospital;
and I would have given, as the resemblance came
to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the
nurse or the sister of charity who might have
helped to cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps
might help! “Do you know you’ve never
said a word to me about your school&mdash;I mean
the old one; never mentioned it in any way?”</p>

<p>He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the
same loveliness. But he clearly gained time; he
waited, he called for guidance. “Haven’t I?”
It wasn’t for <em>me</em> to help him&mdash;it was for the
thing I had met!</p>

<p>Something in his tone and the expression of his
face, as I got this from him, set my heart aching
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
with such a pang as it had never yet known; so
unutterably touching was it to see his little
brain puzzled and his little resources taxed to
play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence
and consistency. “No, never&mdash;from the
hour you came back. You’ve never mentioned
to me one of your masters, one of your comrades,
nor the least little thing that ever happened to
you at school. Never, little Miles&mdash;no, never&mdash;have
you given me an inkling of anything that
<em>may</em> have happened there. Therefore you can
fancy how much I’m in the dark. Until you
came out, that way, this morning, you had, since
the first hour I saw you, scarce even made a reference
to anything in your previous life. You
seemed so perfectly to accept the present.” It
was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of
his secret precocity (or whatever I might call the
poison of an influence that I dared but half to
phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of
his inward trouble, appear as accessible as an
older person&mdash;imposed him almost as an intellectual
equal. “I thought you wanted to go on as
you are.”</p>

<p>It struck me that at this he just faintly coloured.
He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent slightly
fatigued, a languid shake of his head. “I don’t&mdash;I
don’t. I want to get away.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>“You’re tired of Bly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I like Bly.”</p>

<p>“Well, then<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>you</em> know what a boy wants!”</p>

<p>I felt that I didn’t know so well as Miles, and
I took temporary refuge. “You want to go to
your uncle?”</p>

<p>Again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he
made a movement on the pillow. “Ah, you can’t
get off with that!”</p>

<p>I was silent a little, and it was I, now, I think,
who changed colour. “My dear, I don’t want to
get off!”</p>

<p>“You can’t, even if you do. You can’t, you
can’t!”&mdash;he lay beautifully staring. “My uncle
must come down, and you must completely
settle things.”</p>

<p>“If we do,” I returned with some spirit, “you
may be sure it will be to take you quite away.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you understand that that’s exactly
what I’m working for? You’ll have to tell him&mdash;about
the way you’ve let it all drop: you’ll
have to tell him a tremendous lot!”</p>

<p>The exultation with which he uttered this
helped me somehow, for the instant, to meet him
rather more. “And how much will <em>you</em>, Miles,
have to tell him? There are things he’ll ask
you!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>He turned it over. “Very likely. But what
things?”</p>

<p>“The things you’ve never told me. To make
up his mind what to do with you. He can’t
send you back<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to go back!” he broke in.
“I want a new field.”</p>

<p>He said it with admirable serenity, with positive
unimpeachable gaiety; and doubtless it was
that very note that most evoked for me the
poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of
his probable reappearance at the end of three
months with all this bravado and still more dishonour.
It overwhelmed me now that I should
never be able to bear that, and it made me let
myself go. I threw myself upon him and in
the tenderness of my pity I embraced him.
“Dear little Miles, dear little Miles<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>My face was close to his, and he let me kiss
him, simply taking it with indulgent good-humour.
“Well, old lady?”</p>

<p>“Is there nothing&mdash;nothing at all that you
want to tell me?”</p>

<p>He turned off a little, facing round toward
the wall and holding up his hand to look at as
one had seen sick children look. “I’ve told
you&mdash;I told you this morning.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>Oh, I was sorry for him! “That you just
want me not to worry you?”</p>

<p>He looked round at me now, as if in recognition
of my understanding him; then ever so
gently, “To let me alone,” he replied.</p>

<p>There was even a singular little dignity in it,
something that made me release him, yet, when
I had slowly risen, linger beside him. God
knows I never wished to harass him, but I felt
that merely, at this, to turn my back on him
was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose
him. “I’ve just begun a letter to your uncle,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Well, then, finish it!”</p>

<p>I waited a minute. “What happened before?”</p>

<p>He gazed up at me again. “Before what?”</p>

<p>“Before you came back. And before you
went away.”</p>

<p>For some time he was silent, but he continued
to meet my eyes. “What happened?”</p>

<p>It made me, the sound of the words, in which
it seemed to me that I caught for the very first
time a small faint quaver of consenting consciousness&mdash;it
made me drop on my knees beside
the bed and seize once more the chance
of possessing him. “Dear little Miles, dear little
Miles, if you <em>knew</em> how I want to help you!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>
It’s only that, it’s nothing but that, and I’d
rather die than give you a pain or do you a
wrong&mdash;I’d rather die than hurt a hair of you.
Dear little Miles”&mdash;oh, I brought it out now
even if I <em>should</em> go too far&mdash;“I just want you
to help me to save you!” But I knew in a
moment after this that I had gone too far.
The answer to my appeal was instantaneous,
but it came in the form of an extraordinary
blast and chill, a gust of frozen air and a shake
of the room as great as if, in the wild wind,
the casement had crashed in. The boy gave a
loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the
shock of sound, might have seemed, indistinctly,
though I was so close to him, a note either of
jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my feet
again and was conscious of darkness. So for
a moment we remained, while I stared about
me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred
and the window tight. “Why, the candle’s
out!” I then cried.</p>

<p>“It was I who blew it, dear!” said Miles.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>XVIII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> next day, after lessons, Mrs. Grose found
a moment to say to me quietly: “Have you written,
Miss?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I’ve written.” But I didn’t add&mdash;for
the hour&mdash;that my letter, sealed and directed,
was still in my pocket. There would be time
enough to send it before the messenger should go
to the village. Meanwhile there had been, on the
part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more exemplary
morning. It was exactly as if they had
both had at heart to gloss over any recent little
friction. They performed the dizziest feats of
arithmetic, soaring quite out of <em>my</em> feeble range,
and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical
and historical jokes. It was conspicuous
of course in Miles in particular that he
appeared to wish to show how easily he could
let me down. This child, to my memory, really
lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no
words can translate; there was a distinction all
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" title="158"> </a>
his own in every impulse he revealed; never was
a small natural creature, to the uninitiated eye all
frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more
extraordinary little gentleman. I had perpetually
to guard against the wonder of contemplation into
which my initiated view betrayed me; to check
the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which
I constantly both attacked and renounced the
enigma of what such a little gentleman could
have done that deserved a penalty. Say that,
by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of
all evil <em>had</em> been opened up to him: all the justice
within me ached for the proof that it could
ever have flowered into an act.</p>

<p>He had never, at any rate, been such a little
gentleman as when, after our early dinner on this
dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if
I shouldn’t like him, for half an hour, to play to
me. David playing to Saul could never have
shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was
literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity,
and quite tantamount to his saying
outright: “The true knights we love to read
about never push an advantage too far. I know
what you mean now: you mean that&mdash;to be let
alone yourself and not followed up&mdash;you’ll cease
to worry and spy upon me, won’t keep me so
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>
close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I
‘come,’ you see&mdash;but I don’t go! There’ll be
plenty of time for that. I do really delight in
your society, and I only want to show you that I
contended for a principle.” It may be imagined
whether I resisted this appeal or failed to accompany
him again, hand in hand, to the schoolroom.
He sat down at the old piano and played as he
had never played, and if there are those who
think he had better have been kicking a football
I can only say that I wholly agree with them.
For at the end of a time that under his influence
I had quite ceased to measure I started up with
a strange sense of having literally slept at my
post. It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom
fire, and yet I hadn’t really, in the least,
slept: I had only done something much worse&mdash;I
had forgotten. Where, all this time, was
Flora? When I put the question to Miles he
played on a minute before answering, and then
could only say: “Why, my dear, how do <em>I</em>
know?”&mdash;breaking moreover into a happy laugh
which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal
accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent,
extravagant song.</p>

<p>I went straight to my room, but his sister was
not there; then, before going downstairs, I looked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>
into several others. As she was nowhere about
she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in
the comfort of that theory, I accordingly proceeded
in quest of. I found her where I had
found her the evening before, but she met my
quick challenge with blank, scared ignorance.
She had only supposed that, after the repast, I
had carried off both the children; as to which
she was quite in her right, for it was the very
first time I had allowed the little girl out of my
sight without some special provision. Of course
now indeed she might be with the maids, so that
the immediate thing was to look for her without
an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between
us; but when, ten minutes later and in
pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the
hall, it was only to report on either side that
after guarded inquiries we had altogether failed
to trace her. For a minute there, apart from
observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I
could feel with what high interest my friend
returned me all those I had from the first given
her.</p>

<p>“She’ll be above,” she presently said&mdash;“in
one of the rooms you haven’t searched.”</p>

<p>“No; she’s at a distance.” I had made up
my mind. “She has gone out.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>Mrs. Grose stared. “Without a hat?”</p>

<p>I naturally also looked volumes. “Isn’t that
woman always without one?”</p>

<p>“She’s with <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p>“She’s with <em>her</em>!” I declared. “We must
find them.”</p>

<p>My hand was on my friend’s arm, but she
failed for the moment, confronted with such an
account of the matter, to respond to my pressure.
She communed, on the contrary, on the
spot, with her uneasiness. “And where’s
Master Miles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>he’s</em> with Quint. They’re in the schoolroom.”</p>

<p>“Lord, Miss!” My view, I was myself
aware&mdash;and therefore I suppose my tone&mdash;had
never yet reached so calm an assurance.</p>

<p>“The trick’s played,” I went on; “they’ve
successfully worked their plan. He found the
most divine little way to keep me quiet while
she went off.”</p>

<p>“‘Divine’?” Mrs. Grose bewilderedly echoed.</p>

<p>“Infernal, then!” I almost cheerfully rejoined.
“He has provided for himself as well.
But come!”</p>

<p>She had helplessly gloomed at the upper
regions. “You leave him<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>“So long with Quint? Yes&mdash;I don’t mind
that now.”</p>

<p>She always ended, at these moments, by getting
possession of my hand, and in this manner
she could at present still stay me. But after
gasping an instant at my sudden resignation,
“Because of your letter?” she eagerly brought
out.</p>

<p>I quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter,
drew it forth, held it up, and then, freeing
myself, went and laid it on the great hall-table.
“Luke will take it,” I said as I came back. I
reached the house-door and opened it; I was
already on the steps.</p>

<p>My companion still demurred: the storm of
the night and the early morning had dropped,
but the afternoon was damp and grey. I came
down to the drive while she stood in the doorway.
“You go with nothing on?”</p>

<p>“What do I care when the child has nothing?
I can’t wait to dress,” I cried, “and if you must
do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile, yourself,
upstairs.”</p>

<p>“With <em>them</em>?” Oh, on this, the poor woman
promptly joined me!</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>XIX</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">We</span> went straight to the lake, as it was called
at Bly, and I dare say rightly called, though I
reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet of
water less remarkable than it appeared to my
untravelled eyes. My acquaintance with sheets
of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at all
events on the few occasions of my consenting,
under the protection of my pupils, to affront
its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat moored
there for our use, had impressed me both with
its extent and its agitation. The usual place
of embarkation was half a mile from the house,
but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever
Flora might be, she was not near home. She
had not given me the slip for any small adventure,
and, since the day of the very great
one that I had shared with her by the pond,
I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter
to which she most inclined. This was why I
had now given to Mrs. Grose’s steps so marked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>
a direction&mdash;a direction that made her, when
she perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed
me she was freshly mystified. “You’re going to
the water, Miss?&mdash;you think she’s <em>in</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“She may be, though the depth is, I believe,
nowhere very great. But what I judge most
likely is that she’s on the spot from which, the
other day, we saw together what I told you.”</p>

<p>“When she pretended not to see<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“With that astounding self-possession! I’ve
always been sure she wanted to go back alone.
And now her brother has managed it for her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped.
“You suppose they really <em>talk</em> of them?”</p>

<p>I could meet this with a confidence! “They
say things that, if we heard them, would simply
appal us.”</p>

<p>“And if she <em>is</em> there<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Then Miss Jessel is?”</p>

<p>“Beyond a doubt. You shall see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” my friend cried, planted
so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on
without her. By the time I reached the pool,
however, she was close behind me, and I knew
that, whatever, to her apprehension, might befall
me, the exposure of my society struck her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
as her least danger. She exhaled a moan of
relief as we at last came in sight of the greater
part of the water without a sight of the child.
There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side
of the bank where my observation of her had
been most startling, and none on the opposite
edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty
yards, a thick copse came down to the water.
The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant
compared to its length that, with its ends out
of view, it might have been taken for a scant
river. We looked at the empty expanse, and
then I felt the suggestion of my friend’s eyes.
I knew what she meant and I replied with a
negative headshake.</p>

<p>“No, no; wait! She has taken the boat.”</p>

<p>My companion stared at the vacant mooring-place
and then again across the lake. “Then
where is it?”</p>

<p>“Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs.
She has used it to go over, and then has managed
to hide it.”</p>

<p>“All alone&mdash;that child?”</p>

<p>“She’s not alone, and at such times she’s not a
child: she’s an old, old woman.” I scanned all
the visible shore while Mrs. Grose took again, into
the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>
of submission; then I pointed out that the boat
might perfectly be in a small refuge formed by one
of the recesses of the pool, an indentation masked,
for the hither side, by a projection of the bank
and by a clump of trees growing close to the
water.</p>

<p>“But if the boat’s there, where on earth’s <em>she</em>?”
my colleague anxiously asked.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what we must learn.” And I
started to walk further.</p>

<p>“By going all the way round?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but
ten minutes, but it’s far enough to have made the
child prefer not to walk. She went straight
over.”</p>

<p>“Laws!” cried my friend again; the chain of
my logic was ever too much for her. It dragged
her at my heels even now, and when we had got
half-way round&mdash;a devious, tiresome process, on
ground much broken and by a path choked with
overgrowth&mdash;I paused to give her breath. I
sustained her with a grateful arm, assuring her
that she might hugely help me; and this started
us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes
more we reached a point from which we found
the boat to be where I had supposed it. It had
been intentionally left as much as possible out of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>
sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence
that came, just there, down to the brink and that
had been an assistance to disembarking. I recognised,
as I looked at the pair of short, thick
oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character
of the feat for a little girl; but I had lived,
by this time, too long among wonders and had
panted to too many livelier measures. There was
a gate in the fence, through which we passed, and
that brought us, after a trifling interval, more
into the open. Then, “There she is!” we both
exclaimed at once.</p>

<p>Flora, a short way off, stood before us on the
grass and smiled as if her performance was now
complete. The next thing she did, however, was
to stoop straight down and pluck&mdash;quite as if it
were all she was there for&mdash;a big, ugly spray of
withered fern. I instantly became sure she had
just come out of the copse. She waited for us,
not herself taking a step, and I was conscious
of the rare solemnity with which we presently
approached her. She smiled and smiled, and we
met; but it was all done in a silence by this time
flagrantly ominous. Mrs. Grose was the first to
break the spell: she threw herself on her knees
and, drawing the child to her breast, clasped in
a long embrace the little tender, yielding body.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>
While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only
watch it&mdash;which I did the more intently when I
saw Flora’s face peep at me over our companion’s
shoulder. It was serious now&mdash;the flicker had
left it; but it strengthened the pang with which
I at that moment envied Mrs. Grose the simplicity
of <em>her</em> relation. Still, all this while, nothing more
passed between us save that Flora had let her
foolish fern again drop to the ground. What
she and I had virtually said to each other was
that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs.
Grose finally got up she kept the child’s hand, so
that the two were still before me; and the
singular reticence of our communion was even
more marked in the frank look she launched me.
“I’ll be hanged,” it said, “if <em>I’ll</em> speak!”</p>

<p>It was Flora who, gazing all over me in candid
wonder, was the first. She was struck with our
bareheaded aspect. “Why, where are your
things?”</p>

<p>“Where yours are, my dear!” I promptly
returned.</p>

<p>She had already got back her gaiety, and
appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient.
“And where’s Miles?” she went on.</p>

<p>There was something in the small valour of
it that quite finished me: these three words
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>
from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a
drawn blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand,
for weeks and weeks, had held high and full
to the brim and that now, even before speaking,
I felt overflow in a deluge. “I’ll tell you if
you’ll tell <em>me</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” I heard myself say, then
heard the tremor in which it broke.</p>

<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose’s suspense blazed at me, but it
was too late now, and I brought the thing out
handsomely. “Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>XX</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">Just</span> as in the churchyard with Miles, the
whole thing was upon us. Much as I had
made of the fact that this name had never once,
between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten
glare with which the child’s face now received
it fairly likened my breach of the silence to
the smash of a pane of glass. It added to the
interposing cry, as if to stay the blow, that Mrs.
Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my
violence&mdash;the shriek of a creature scared, or
rather wounded, which, in turn, within a few
seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own.
I seized my colleague’s arm. “She’s there, she’s
there!”</p>

<p>Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite
bank exactly as she had stood the other time,
and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling
now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having
brought on a proof. She was there, and I was
justified; she was there, and I was neither cruel
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>
nor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs.
Grose, but she was there most for Flora; and
no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps
so extraordinary as that in which I consciously
threw out to her&mdash;with the sense that, pale
and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch
and understand it&mdash;an inarticulate message of
gratitude. She rose erect on the spot my friend
and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in
all the long reach of her desire, an inch of her
evil that fell short. This first vividness of vision
and emotion were things of a few seconds, during
which Mrs. Grose’s dazed blink across to where
I pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that
she too at last saw, just as it carried my own
eyes precipitately to the child. The revelation
then of the manner in which Flora was affected
startled me, in truth, far more than it would have
done to find her also merely agitated, for direct
dismay was of course not what I had expected.
Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had
actually made her, she would repress every
betrayal; and I was therefore shaken, on the spot,
by my first glimpse of the particular one for
which I had not allowed. To see her, without
a convulsion of her small pink face, not even
feign to glance in the direction of the prodigy
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>
I announced, but only, instead of that, turn at
<em>me</em> an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression
absolutely new and unprecedented and
that appeared to read and accuse and judge me&mdash;this
was a stroke that somehow converted the
little girl herself into the very presence that
could make me quail. I quailed even though
my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never
greater than at that instant, and in the immediate
need to defend myself I called it passionately to
witness. “She’s there, you little unhappy thing&mdash;there,
there, <em>there</em>, and you see her as well
as you see me!” I had said shortly before to
Mrs. Grose that she was not at these times a
child, but an old, old woman, and that description
of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed
than in the way in which, for all answer
to this, she simply showed me, without a concession,
an admission, of her eyes, a countenance
of deeper and deeper, of indeed suddenly quite
fixed, reprobation. I was by this time&mdash;if I
can put the whole thing at all together&mdash;more
appalled at what I may properly call her manner
than at anything else, though it was simultaneously
with this that I became aware of
having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably,
to reckon with. My elder companion, the next
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
moment, at any rate, blotted out everything but
her own flushed face and her loud, shocked
protest, a burst of high disapproval. “What a
dreadful turn, to be sure, Miss! Where on earth
do you see anything?”</p>

<p>I could only grasp her more quickly yet, for
even while she spoke the hideous plain presence
stood undimmed and undaunted. It had already
lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued,
seizing my colleague, quite thrusting her at it
and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing
hand. “You don’t see her exactly as <em>we</em>
see?&mdash;you mean to say you don’t now&mdash;<em>now</em>?
She’s as big as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest
woman, <em>look</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” She looked, even as I
did, and gave me, with her deep groan of negation,
repulsion, compassion&mdash;the mixture with
her pity of her relief at her exemption&mdash;a sense,
touching to me even then, that she would have
backed me up if she could. I might well have
needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof
that her eyes were hopelessly sealed I felt my
own situation horribly crumble, I felt&mdash;I saw&mdash;my
livid predecessor press, from her position,
on my defeat, and I was conscious, more than
all, of what I should have from this instant to
deal with in the astounding little attitude of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
Flora. Into this attitude Mrs. Grose immediately
and violently entered, breaking, even while
there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious
private triumph, into breathless reassurance.</p>

<p>“She isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s there&mdash;and
you never see nothing, my sweet! How
can poor Miss Jessel&mdash;when poor Miss Jessel’s
dead and buried? <em>We</em> know, don’t we, love?”&mdash;and
she appealed, blundering in, to the child.
“It’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke&mdash;and
we’ll go home as fast as we can!”</p>

<p>Our companion, on this, had responded with
a strange, quick primness of propriety, and they
were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united,
as it were, in pained opposition to me. Flora
continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation,
and even at that minute I prayed God
to forgive me for seeming to see that, as she
stood there holding tight to our friend’s dress,
her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly
failed, had quite vanished. I’ve said it already&mdash;she
was literally, she was hideously, hard; she
had turned common and almost ugly. “I don’t
know what you mean. I see nobody. I see
nothing. I never <em>have</em>. I think you’re cruel.
I don’t like you!” Then, after this deliverance,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
which might have been that of a vulgarly pert
little girl in the street, she hugged Mrs. Grose
more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful
little face. In this position she produced an
almost furious wail. “Take me away, take me
away&mdash;oh, take me away from <em>her</em>!”</p>

<p>“From <em>me</em>?” I panted.</p>

<p>“From you&mdash;from you!” she cried.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed,
while I had nothing to do but communicate
again with the figure that, on the opposite
bank, without a movement, as rigidly still as if
catching, beyond the interval, our voices, was as
vividly there for my disaster as it was not there
for my service. The wretched child had spoken
exactly as if she had got from some outside source
each of her stabbing little words, and I could
therefore, in the full despair of all I had to accept,
but sadly shake my head at her. “If I had
ever doubted, all my doubt would at present have
gone. I’ve been living with the miserable truth,
and now it has only too much closed round me.
Of course I’ve lost you: I’ve interfered, and
you’ve seen&mdash;under <em>her</em> dictation”&mdash;with which
I faced, over the pool again, our infernal witness&mdash;“the
easy and perfect way to meet it. I’ve
done my best, but I’ve lost you. Good-bye.”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>
For Mrs. Grose I had an imperative, an almost
frantic “Go, go!” before which, in infinite distress,
but mutely possessed of the little girl and
clearly convinced, in spite of her blindness, that
something awful had occurred and some collapse
engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had
come, as fast as she could move.</p>

<p>Of what first happened when I was left alone
I had no subsequent memory. I only knew that
at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an hour,
an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and
piercing my trouble, had made me understand
that I must have thrown myself, on my face, on
the ground and given way to a wildness of grief.
I must have lain there long and cried and sobbed,
for when I raised my head the day was almost
done. I got up and looked a moment, through
the twilight, at the grey pool and its blank,
haunted edge, and then I took, back to the
house, my dreary and difficult course. When
I reached the gate in the fence the boat, to my
surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh reflection
to make on Flora’s extraordinary command
of the situation. She passed that night, by
the most tacit, and I should add, were not the
word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of
arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
of them on my return, but, on the other hand,
as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great
deal of Miles. I saw&mdash;I can use no other phrase&mdash;so
much of him that it was as if it were more
than it had ever been. No evening I had passed
at Bly had the portentous quality of this one;
in spite of which&mdash;and in spite also of the
deeper depths of consternation that had opened
beneath my feet&mdash;there was literally, in the
ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness.
On reaching the house I had never so much as
looked for the boy; I had simply gone straight
to my room to change what I was wearing and to
take in, at a glance, much material testimony to
Flora’s rupture. Her little belongings had all
been removed. When later, by the schoolroom
fire, I was served with tea by the usual maid, I
indulged, on the article of my other pupil, in
no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now&mdash;he
might have it to the end! Well, he did
have it; and it consisted&mdash;in part at least&mdash;of
his coming in at about eight o’clock and
sitting down with me in silence. On the removal
of the tea-things I had blown out the
candles and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious
of a mortal coldness and felt as if I
should never again be warm. So, when he appeared,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>
I was sitting in the glow with my
thoughts. He paused a moment by the door
as if to look at me; then&mdash;as if to share them&mdash;came
to the other side of the hearth and
sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute
stillness; yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>XXI</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">Before</span> a new day, in my room, had fully
broken, my eyes opened to Mrs. Grose, who had
come to my bedside with worse news. Flora
was so markedly feverish that an illness was
perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of
extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by
fears that had for their subject not in the least
her former, but wholly her present, governess. It
was not against the possible re-entrance of Miss
Jessel on the scene that she protested&mdash;it was
conspicuously and passionately against mine. I
was promptly on my feet of course, and with an
immense deal to ask; the more that my friend
had discernibly now girded her loins to meet me
once more. This I felt as soon as I had put
to her the question of her sense of the child’s
sincerity as against my own. “She persists in
denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen,
anything?”</p>

<p>My visitor’s trouble, truly, was great. “Ah,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
Miss, it isn’t a matter on which I can push her!
Yet it isn’t either, I must say, as if I much
needed to. It has made her, every inch of her,
quite old.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see her perfectly from here. She resents,
for all the world like some high little
personage, the imputation on her truthfulness
and, as it were, her respectability. ‘Miss Jessel
indeed&mdash;<em>she</em>!’ Ah, she’s ‘respectable,’ the chit!
The impression she gave me there yesterday was,
I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was
quite beyond any of the others. I <em>did</em> put my
foot in it! She’ll never speak to me again.”</p>

<p>Hideous and obscure as it all was, it held
Mrs. Grose briefly silent; then she granted my
point with a frankness which, I made sure, had
more behind it. “I think indeed, Miss, she never
will. She do have a grand manner about it!”</p>

<p>“And that manner”&mdash;I summed it up&mdash;“is
practically what’s the matter with her now!”</p>

<p>Oh, that manner, I could see in my visitor’s
face, and not a little else besides! “She asks
me every three minutes if I think you’re coming
in.”</p>

<p>“I see&mdash;I see.” I too, on my side, had so
much more than worked it out. “Has she said
to you since yesterday&mdash;except to repudiate her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
familiarity with anything so dreadful&mdash;a single
other word about Miss Jessel?”</p>

<p>“Not one, Miss. And of course you know,”
my friend added, “I took it from her, by the
lake, that, just then and there at least, there <em>was</em>
nobody.”</p>

<p>“Rather! And, naturally, you take it from
her still.”</p>

<p>“I don’t contradict her. What else can I do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing in the world! You’ve the cleverest
little person to deal with. They’ve made them&mdash;their
two friends, I mean&mdash;still cleverer even
than nature did; for it was wondrous material
to play on! Flora has now her grievance, and
she’ll work it to the end.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss; but to <em>what</em> end?”</p>

<p>“Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle.
She’ll make me out to him the lowest creature<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>I winced at the fair show of the scene in
Mrs. Grose’s face; she looked for a minute as
if she sharply saw them together. “And him
who thinks so well of you!”</p>

<p>“He has an odd way&mdash;it comes over me
now,” I laughed, “&mdash;of proving it! But that
doesn’t matter. What Flora wants, of course, is
to get rid of me.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>My companion bravely concurred. “Never
again to so much as look at you.”</p>

<p>“So that what you’ve come to me now for,”
I asked, “is to speed me on my way?” Before
she had time to reply, however, I had her in
check. “I’ve a better idea&mdash;the result of my
reflections. My going <em>would</em> seem the right
thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it.
Yet that won’t do. It’s <em>you</em> who must go.
You must take Flora.”</p>

<p>My visitor, at this, did speculate. “But
where in the world<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Away from here. Away from <em>them</em>. Away,
even most of all, now, from me. Straight to
her uncle.”</p>

<p>“Only to tell on you<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“No, not ‘only’! To leave me, in addition,
with my remedy.”</p>

<p>She was still vague. “And what <em>is</em> your
remedy?”</p>

<p>“Your loyalty, to begin with. And then
Miles’s.”</p>

<p>She looked at me hard. “Do you think
he<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Won’t if he has the chance, turn on me?
Yes, I venture still to think it. At all events,
I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>
as possible and leave me with him alone.” I
was amazed, myself, at the spirit I had still in
reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more
disconcerted at the way in which, in spite of
this fine example of it, she hesitated. “There’s
one thing, of course,” I went on: “they mustn’t,
before she goes, see each other for three seconds.”
Then it came over me that, in spite of Flora’s
presumable sequestration from the instant of
her return from the pool, it might already be
too late. “Do you mean,” I anxiously asked,
“that they <em>have</em> met?”</p>

<p>At this she quite flushed. “Ah, Miss, I’m
not such a fool as that! If I’ve been obliged
to leave her three or four times, it has been
each time with one of the maids, and at present,
though she’s alone, she’s locked in safe.
And yet&mdash;and yet!” There were too many
things.</p>

<p>“And yet what?”</p>

<p>“Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure of anything but <em>you</em>. But I
have, since last evening, a new hope. I think
he wants to give me an opening. I do believe
that&mdash;poor little exquisite wretch!&mdash;he wants
to speak. Last evening, in the firelight and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
the silence, he sat with me for two hours as if
it were just coming.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grose looked hard, through the window,
at the grey, gathering day. “And did it come?”</p>

<p>“No, though I waited and waited, I confess
it didn’t, and it was without a breach of the
silence or so much as a faint allusion to his
sister’s condition and absence that we at last
kissed for good-night. All the same,” I continued,
“I can’t, if her uncle sees her, consent
to his seeing her brother without my having
given the boy&mdash;and most of all because things
have got so bad&mdash;a little more time.”</p>

<p>My friend appeared on this ground more reluctant
than I could quite understand. “What
do you mean by more time?”</p>

<p>“Well, a day or two&mdash;really to bring it out.
He’ll then be on <em>my</em> side&mdash;of which you see
the importance. If nothing comes, I shall only
fail, and you will, at the worst, have helped
me by doing, on your arrival in town, whatever
you may have found possible.” So I put it
before her, but she continued for a little so
inscrutably embarrassed that I came again to
her aid. “Unless, indeed,” I wound up, “you
really want <em>not</em> to go.”</p>

<p>I could see it, in her face, at last clear itself;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>
she put out her hand to me as a pledge. “I’ll
go&mdash;I’ll go. I’ll go this morning.”</p>

<p>I wanted to be very just. “If you <em>should</em>
wish still to wait, I would engage she shouldn’t
see me.”</p>

<p>“No, no: it’s the place itself. She must leave
it.” She held me a moment with heavy eyes,
then brought out the rest. “Your idea’s the
right one. I myself, Miss<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay.”</p>

<p>The look she gave me with it made me jump
at possibilities. “You mean that, since yesterday,
you <em>have</em> seen<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>She shook her head with dignity. “I’ve
<em>heard</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“Heard?”</p>

<p>“From that child&mdash;horrors! There!” she
sighed with tragic relief. “On my honour, Miss,
she says things<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” But at this evocation
she broke down; she dropped, with a sudden
sob, upon my sofa and, as I had seen her do
before, gave way to all the grief of it.</p>

<p>It was quite in another manner that I, for
my part, let myself go. “Oh, thank God!”</p>

<p>She sprang up again at this, drying her eyes
with a groan. “‘Thank God’?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>“It so justifies me!”</p>

<p>“It does that, Miss!”</p>

<p>I couldn’t have desired more emphasis, but
I just hesitated. “She’s so horrible?”</p>

<p>I saw my colleague scarce knew how to put
it. “Really shocking.”</p>

<p>“And about me?”</p>

<p>“About you, Miss&mdash;since you must have it.
It’s beyond everything, for a young lady; and
I can’t think wherever she must have picked
up<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“The appalling language she applied to me?
I can, then!” I broke in with a laugh that was
doubtless significant enough.</p>

<p>It only, in truth, left my friend still more
grave. “Well, perhaps I ought to also&mdash;since
I’ve heard some of it before! Yet I can’t bear
it,” the poor woman went on while, with the
same movement, she glanced, on my dressing-table,
at the face of my watch. “But I must
go back.”</p>

<p>I kept her, however. “Ah, if you can’t bear
it<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“How can I stop with her, you mean? Why,
just <em>for</em> that: to get her away. Far from this,”
she pursued, “far from <em>them</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“She may be different? she may be free?”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
I seized her almost with joy. “Then, in spite
of yesterday, you <em>believe</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“In such doings?” Her simple description
of them required, in the light of her expression,
to be carried no further, and she gave me the
whole thing as she had never done. “I believe.”</p>

<p>Yes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder
to shoulder: if I might continue sure of that
I should care but little what else happened.
My support in the presence of disaster would
be the same as it had been in my early need
of confidence, and if my friend would answer
for my honesty, I would answer for all the rest.
On the point of taking leave of her, none the
less, I was to some extent embarrassed. “There’s
one thing of course&mdash;it occurs to me&mdash;to remember.
My letter, giving the alarm, will have
reached town before you.”</p>

<p>I now perceived still more how she had been
beating about the bush and how weary at last
it had made her. “Your letter won’t have got
there. Your letter never went.”</p>

<p>“What then became of it?”</p>

<p>“Goodness knows! Master Miles<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Do you mean <em>he</em> took it?” I gasped.</p>

<p>She hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance.
“I mean that I saw yesterday, when I came back
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>
with Miss Flora, that it wasn’t where you had
put it. Later in the evening I had the chance
to question Luke, and he declared that he had
neither noticed nor touched it.” We could only
exchange, on this, one of our deeper mutual
soundings, and it was Mrs. Grose who first
brought up the plumb with an almost elate
“You see!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see that if Miles took it instead he
probably will have read it and destroyed it.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you see anything else?”</p>

<p>I faced her a moment with a sad smile. “It
strikes me that by this time your eyes are open
even wider than mine.”</p>

<p>They proved to be so indeed, but she could
still blush, almost, to show it. “I make out
now what he must have done at school.” And
she gave, in her simple sharpness, an almost
droll disillusioned nod. “He stole!”</p>

<p>I turned it over&mdash;I tried to be more judicial.
“Well&mdash;perhaps.”</p>

<p>She looked as if she found me unexpectedly
calm. “He stole <em>letters</em>!”</p>

<p>She couldn’t know my reasons for a calmness
after all pretty shallow; so I showed them off
as I might. “I hope then it was to more purpose
than in this case! The note, at any rate,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>
that I put on the table yesterday,” I pursued,
“will have given him so scant an advantage&mdash;for
it contained only the bare demand for an
interview&mdash;that he is already much ashamed
of having gone so far for so little, and that
what he had on his mind last evening was precisely
the need of confession.” I seemed to
myself, for the instant, to have mastered it, to
see it all. “Leave us, leave us”&mdash;I was already,
at the door, hurrying her off. “I’ll get it out
of him. He’ll meet me&mdash;he’ll confess. If he
confesses, he’s saved. And if he’s saved<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Then <em>you</em> are?” The dear woman kissed
me on this, and I took her farewell. “I’ll save
you without him!” she cried as she went.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>XXII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">Yet</span> it was when she had got off&mdash;and I missed
her on the spot&mdash;that the great pinch really
came. If I had counted on what it would give
me to find myself alone with Miles, I speedily
perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure.
No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed
with apprehensions as that of my coming down to
learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and
my younger pupil had already rolled out of the
gates. Now I <em>was</em>, I said to myself, face to face
with the elements, and for much of the rest of the
day, while I fought my weakness, I could consider
that I had been supremely rash. It was a
tighter place still than I had yet turned round in;
all the more that, for the first time, I could see in
the aspect of others a confused reflection of the
crisis. What had happened naturally caused
them all to stare; there was too little of the
explained, throw out whatever we might, in the
suddenness of my colleague’s act. The maids
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>
and the men looked blank; the effect of which on
my nerves was an aggravation until I saw the
necessity of making it a positive aid. It was precisely,
in short, by just clutching the helm that I
avoided total wreck; and I dare say that, to bear
up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and
very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I
was charged with much to do, and I caused it to
be known as well that, left thus to myself, I was
quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that
manner, for the next hour or two, all over the
place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I were
ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom
it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart.</p>

<p>The person it appeared least to concern proved
to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations
had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse
of him, but they had tended to make more public
the change taking place in our relation as a consequence
of his having at the piano, the day before,
kept me, in Flora’s interest, so beguiled and befooled.
The stamp of publicity had of course
been fully given by her confinement and departure,
and the change itself was now ushered in by
our non-observance of the regular custom of the
schoolroom. He had already disappeared when,
on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
learned below that he had breakfasted&mdash;in the
presence of a couple of the maids&mdash;with Mrs.
Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as
he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected,
could better have expressed his frank
view of the abrupt transformation of my office.
What he would now permit this office to consist
of was yet to be settled: there was a queer relief,
at all events&mdash;I mean for myself in especial&mdash;in
the renouncement of one pretension. If so much
had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too
strongly in saying that what had perhaps sprung
highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the
fiction that I had anything more to teach him.
It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks
in which even more than myself he carried out
the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to
him to let me off straining to meet him on the
ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate
his freedom now; I was never to touch it again;
as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his
joining me in the schoolroom the previous night,
I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just
concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too
much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet
when he at last arrived the difficulty of applying
them, the accumulations of my problem, were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
brought straight home to me by the beautiful
little presence on which what had occurred had as
yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.</p>

<p>To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated
I decreed that my meals with the boy
should be served, as we called it, downstairs;
so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous
pomp of the room outside of the window of which
I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first scared
Sunday, my flash of something it would scarce
have done to call light. Here at present I felt
afresh&mdash;for I had felt it again and again&mdash;how
my equilibrium depended on the success of my
rigid will, the will to shut my eyes as tight as
possible to the truth that what I had to deal with
was, revoltingly, against nature. I could only
get on at all by taking “nature” into my confidence
and my account, by treating my monstrous
ordeal as a push in a direction unusual,
of course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after
all, for a fair front, only another turn of the
screw of ordinary human virtue. No attempt,
none the less, could well require more tact than
just this attempt to supply, one’s self, <em>all</em> the
nature. How could I put even a little of that
article into a suppression of reference to what
had occurred? How, on the other hand, could
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>
I make a reference without a new plunge into
the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer,
after a time, had come to me, and it was so
far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably,
by the quickened vision of what was rare in
my little companion. It was indeed as if he
had found even now&mdash;as he had so often found
at lessons&mdash;still some other delicate way to
ease me off. Wasn’t there light in the fact
which, as we shared our solitude, broke out
with a specious glitter it had never yet quite
worn?&mdash;the fact that (opportunity aiding,
precious opportunity which had now come)
it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed,
to forgo the help one might wrest from
absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence
been given him for but to save him? Mightn’t
one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an
angular arm over his character? It was as if,
when we were face to face in the dining-room,
he had literally shown me the way. The roast
mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed
with attendance. Miles, before he sat down,
stood a moment with his hands in his pockets
and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on
the point of passing some humorous judgment.
But what he presently produced was: “I say,
my dear, is she really very awfully ill?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>“Little Flora? Not so bad but that she’ll
presently be better. London will set her up.
Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here
and take your mutton.”</p>

<p>He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully
to his seat, and, when he was established,
went on. “Did Bly disagree with her so terribly
suddenly?”</p>

<p>“Not so suddenly as you might think. One
had seen it coming on.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you get her off before?”</p>

<p>“Before what?”</p>

<p>“Before she became too ill to travel.”</p>

<p>I found myself prompt. “She’s <em>not</em> too ill to
travel: she only might have become so if she
had stayed. This was just the moment to
seize. The journey will dissipate the influence”&mdash;oh,
I was grand!&mdash;“and carry it off.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see”&mdash;Miles, for that matter, was
grand too. He settled to his repast with the
charming little “table manner” that, from the
day of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness
of admonition. Whatever he had been
driven from school for, it was not for ugly
feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today;
but he was unmistakeably more conscious.
He was discernibly trying to take for granted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>
more things than he found, without assistance,
quite easy; and he dropped into peaceful silence
while he felt his situation. Our meal was of
the briefest&mdash;mine a vain pretence, and I had
the things immediately removed. While this
was done Miles stood again with his hands in
his little pockets and his back to me&mdash;stood
and looked out of the wide window through
which, that other day, I had seen what pulled
me up. We continued silent while the maid
was with us&mdash;as silent, it whimsically occurred
to me, as some young couple who, on their
wedding-journey, at the inn, feel shy in the
presence of the waiter. He turned round only
when the waiter had left us. “Well&mdash;so we’re
alone!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>XXIII</h3>

<p>“<span class="small-caps">Oh</span>, more or less.” I fancy my smile was
pale. “Not absolutely. We shouldn’t like
that!” I went on.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I suppose we shouldn’t. Of course we
have the others.”</p>

<p>“We have the others&mdash;we have indeed the
others,” I concurred.</p>

<p>“Yet even though we have them,” he returned,
still with his hands in his pockets and
planted there in front of me, “they don’t much
count, do they?”</p>

<p>I made the best of it, but I felt wan. “It
depends on what you call ‘much’!”</p>

<p>“Yes”&mdash;with all accommodation&mdash;“everything
depends!” On this, however, he faced
to the window again and presently reached it
with his vague, restless, cogitating step. He
remained there awhile, with his forehead against
the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs
I knew and the dull things of November. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
had always my hypocrisy of “work,” behind
which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself
with it there as I had repeatedly done at
those moments of torment that I have described
as the moments of my knowing the children
to be given to something from which I was
barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being
prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary
impression dropped on me as I extracted a meaning
from the boy’s embarrassed back&mdash;none
other than the impression that I was not barred
now. This inference grew in a few minutes
to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with
the direct perception that it was positively <em>he</em>
who was. The frames and squares of the great
window were a kind of image, for him, of a
kind of failure. I felt that I saw him, at any
rate, shut in or shut out. He was admirable,
but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb
of hope. Wasn’t he looking, through the
haunted pane, for something he couldn’t see?&mdash;and
wasn’t it the first time in the whole
business that he had known such a lapse? The
first, the very first: I found it a splendid portent.
It made him anxious, though he watched
himself; he had been anxious all day and, even
while in his usual sweet little manner he sat
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
at table, had needed all his small strange genius
to give it a gloss. When he at last turned
round to meet me, it was almost as if this
genius had succumbed. “Well, I think I’m
glad Bly agrees with <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>“You would certainly seem to have seen, these
twenty-four hours, a good deal more of it than
for some time before. I hope,” I went on
bravely, “that you’ve been enjoying yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve been ever so far; all round
about&mdash;miles and miles away. I’ve never been
so free.”</p>

<p>He had really a manner of his own, and I
could only try to keep up with him. “Well, do
you like it?”</p>

<p>He stood there smiling; then at last he put
into two words&mdash;“Do <em>you</em>?”&mdash;more discrimination
than I had ever heard two words contain.
Before I had time to deal with that, however, he
continued as if with the sense that this was an
impertinence to be softened. “Nothing could
be more charming than the way you take it, for
of course if we’re alone together now it’s you
that are alone most. But I hope,” he threw in,
“you don’t particularly mind!”</p>

<p>“Having to do with you?” I asked. “My
dear child, how can I help minding? Though
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a>
I’ve renounced all claim to your company,&mdash;you’re
so beyond me,&mdash;I at least greatly enjoy
it. What else should I stay on for?”</p>

<p>He looked at me more directly, and the expression
of his face, graver now, struck me as the
most beautiful I had ever found in it. “You
stay on just for <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I stay on as your friend and from
the tremendous interest I take in you till something
can be done for you that may be more
worth your while. That needn’t surprise you.”
My voice trembled so that I felt it impossible to
suppress the shake. “Don’t you remember how
I told you, when I came and sat on your bed the
night of the storm, that there was nothing in the
world I wouldn’t do for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” He, on his side, more and more
visibly nervous, had a tone to master; but he was
so much more successful than I that, laughing
out through his gravity, he could pretend we
were pleasantly jesting. “Only that, I think,
was to get me to do something for <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“It was partly to get you to do something,” I
conceded. “But, you know, you didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he said with the brightest superficial
eagerness, “you wanted me to tell you something.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>“That’s it. Out, straight out. What you
have on your mind, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, is <em>that</em> what you’ve stayed over
for?”</p>

<p>He spoke with a gaiety through which I could
still catch the finest little quiver of resentful
passion; but I can’t begin to express the effect
upon me of an implication of surrender even so
faint. It was as if what I had yearned for had
come at last only to astonish me. “Well, yes&mdash;I
may as well make a clean breast of it. It was
precisely for that.”</p>

<p>He waited so long that I supposed it for the
purpose of repudiating the assumption on which
my action had been founded; but what he finally
said was: “Do you mean now&mdash;here?”</p>

<p>“There couldn’t be a better place or time.”
He looked round him uneasily, and I had the
rare&mdash;oh, the queer!&mdash;impression of the very
first symptom I had seen in him of the approach
of immediate fear. It was as if he were suddenly
afraid of me&mdash;which struck me indeed as
perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the
very pang of the effort I felt it vain to try sternness,
and I heard myself the next instant so
gentle as to be almost grotesque. “You want so
to go out again?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>“Awfully!” He smiled at me heroically, and
the touching little bravery of it was enhanced by
his actually flushing with pain. He had picked
up his hat, which he had brought in, and stood
twirling it in a way that gave me, even as I was
just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of
what I was doing. To do it in <em>any</em> way was
an act of violence, for what did it consist of but
the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt
on a small helpless creature who had been for
me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful
intercourse? Wasn’t it base to create for a being
so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose
I now read into our situation a clearness
it couldn’t have had at the time, for I seem
to see our poor eyes already lighted with some
spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to
come. So we circled about, with terrors and
scruples, like fighters not daring to close. But
it was for each other we feared! That kept us
a little longer suspended and unbruised. “I’ll
tell you everything,” Miles said&mdash;“I mean I’ll
tell you anything you like. You’ll stay on with
me, and we shall both be all right and I <em>will</em> tell
you&mdash;I <em>will</em>. But not now.”</p>

<p>“Why not now?”</p>

<p>My insistence turned him from me and kept
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203"> </a>
him once more at his window in a silence during
which, between us, you might have heard a pin
drop. Then he was before me again with the air
of a person for whom, outside, someone who had
frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. “I
have to see Luke.”</p>

<p>I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar
a lie, and I felt proportionately ashamed. But,
horrible as it was, his lies made up my truth. I
achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting.
“Well, then, go to Luke, and I’ll wait for what
you promise. Only, in return for that, satisfy,
before you leave me, one very much smaller
request.”</p>

<p>He looked as if he felt he had succeeded
enough to be able still a little to bargain.
“Very much smaller<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a mere fraction of the whole. Tell me”&mdash;oh,
my work preoccupied me, and I was off-hand!&mdash;“if,
yesterday afternoon, from the table
in the hall, you took, you know, my letter.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" title="204"> </a>XXIV</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">My</span> sense of how he received this suffered for a
minute from something that I can describe only
as a fierce split of my attention&mdash;a stroke that at
first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the
mere blind movement of getting hold of him,
drawing him close, and, while I just fell for support
against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively
keeping him with his back to the window.
The appearance was full upon us that I
had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint
had come into view like a sentinel before a prison.
The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he
had reached the window, and then I knew that,
close to the glass and glaring in through it, he
offered once more to the room his white face of
damnation. It represents but grossly what took
place within me at the sight to say that on the
second my decision was made; yet I believe that
no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time
recovered her grasp of the <em>act</em>. It came to me in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>
the very horror of the immediate presence that
the act would be, seeing and facing what I saw
and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. The
inspiration&mdash;I can call it by no other name&mdash;was
that I felt how voluntarily, how transcendently,
I <em>might</em>. It was like fighting with a demon for a
human soul, and when I had fairly so appraised
it I saw how the human soul&mdash;held out, in the
tremor of my hands, at arm’s length&mdash;had a perfect
dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead.
The face that was close to mine was as white as
the face against the glass, and out of it presently
came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from
much further away, that I drank like a waft of
fragrance.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I took it.”</p>

<p>At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew
him close; and while I held him to my breast,
where I could feel in the sudden fever of his little
body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, I
kept my eyes on the thing at the window and saw
it move and shift its posture. I have likened it
to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment,
was rather the prowl of a baffled beast. My
present quickened courage, however, was such
that, not too much to let it through, I had to
shade, as it were, my flame. Meanwhile the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
glare of the face was again at the window, the
scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. It was
the very confidence that I might now defy him,
as well as the positive certitude, by this time, of
the child’s unconsciousness, that made me go on.
“What did you take it for?”</p>

<p>“To see what you said about me.”</p>

<p>“You opened the letter?”</p>

<p>“I opened it.”</p>

<p>My eyes were now, as I held him off a little
again, on Miles’s own face, in which the collapse
of mockery showed me how complete was the
ravage of uneasiness. What was prodigious was
that at last, by my success, his sense was sealed
and his communication stopped: he knew that
he was in presence, but knew not of what, and
knew still less that I also was and that I did
know. And what did this strain of trouble matter
when my eyes went back to the window only
to see that the air was clear again and&mdash;by my
personal triumph&mdash;the influence quenched?
There was nothing there. I felt that the cause
was mine and that I should surely get <em>all</em>. “And
you found nothing!”&mdash;I let my elation out.</p>

<p>He gave the most mournful, thoughtful little
headshake. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing!” I almost shouted in my
joy.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>“Nothing, nothing,” he sadly repeated.</p>

<p>I kissed his forehead; it was drenched. “So
what have you done with it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve burnt it.”</p>

<p>“Burnt it?” It was now or never. “Is that
what you did at school?”</p>

<p>Oh, what this brought up! “At school?”</p>

<p>“Did you take letters?&mdash;or other things?”</p>

<p>“Other things?” He appeared now to be
thinking of something far off and that reached
him only through the pressure of his anxiety.
Yet it did reach him. “Did I <em>steal</em>?”</p>

<p>I felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as
well as wonder if it were more strange to put to
a gentleman such a question or to see him take it
with allowances that gave the very distance of
his fall in the world. “Was it for that you
mightn’t go back?”</p>

<p>The only thing he felt was rather a dreary
little surprise. “Did you know I mightn’t go
back?”</p>

<p>“I know everything.”</p>

<p>He gave me at this the longest and strangest
look. “Everything?”</p>

<p>“Everything. Therefore <em>did</em> you<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” But
I couldn’t say it again.</p>

<p>Miles could, very simply. “No. I didn’t
steal.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>My face must have shown him I believed him
utterly; yet my hands&mdash;but it was for pure tenderness&mdash;shook
him as if to ask him why, if it
was all for nothing, he had condemned me to
months of torment. “What then did you
do?”</p>

<p>He looked in vague pain all round the top of
the room and drew his breath, two or three times
over, as if with difficulty. He might have been
standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his
eyes to some faint green twilight. “Well&mdash;I
said things.”</p>

<p>“Only that?”</p>

<p>“They thought it was enough!”</p>

<p>“To turn you out for?”</p>

<p>Never, truly, had a person “turned out” shown
so little to explain it as this little person! He
appeared to weigh my question, but in a manner
quite detached and almost helpless. “Well, I
suppose I oughtn’t.”</p>

<p>“But to whom did you say them?”</p>

<p>He evidently tried to remember, but it dropped&mdash;he
had lost it. “I don’t know!”</p>

<p>He almost smiled at me in the desolation of his
surrender, which was indeed practically, by this
time, so complete that I ought to have left it there.
But I was infatuated&mdash;I was blind with victory,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
though even then the very effect that was to have
brought him so much nearer was already that of
added separation. “Was it to everyone?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No; it was only to<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” But he gave a sick
little headshake. “I don’t remember their names.”</p>

<p>“Were they then so many?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;only a few. Those I liked.”</p>

<p>Those he liked? I seemed to float not into
clearness, but into a darker obscure, and within a
minute there had come to me out of my very pity
the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent.
It was for the instant confounding and bottomless,
for if he <em>were</em> innocent, what then on earth
was <em>I</em>? Paralysed, while it lasted, by the mere
brush of the question, I let him go a little, so that,
with a deep-drawn sigh, he turned away from me
again; which, as he faced toward the clear window,
I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now
there to keep him from. “And did they repeat
what you said?” I went on after a moment.</p>

<p>He was soon at some distance from me, still
breathing hard and again with the air, though now
without anger for it, of being confined against his
will. Once more, as he had done before, he looked
up at the dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained
him, nothing was left but an unspeakable
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" title="210"> </a>
anxiety. “Oh, yes,” he nevertheless replied&mdash;“they
must have repeated them. To those <em>they</em>
liked,” he added.</p>

<p>There was, somehow, less of it than I had expected;
but I turned it over. “And these things
came round<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“To the masters? Oh, yes!” he answered very
simply. “But I didn’t know they’d tell.”</p>

<p>“The masters? They didn’t&mdash;they’ve never
told. That’s why I ask you.”</p>

<p>He turned to me again his little beautiful
fevered face. “Yes, it was too bad.”</p>

<p>“Too bad?”</p>

<p>“What I suppose I sometimes said. To write
home.”</p>

<p>I can’t name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction
given to such a speech by such a
speaker; I only know that the next instant I
heard myself throw off with homely force:
“Stuff and nonsense!” But the next after that
I must have sounded stern enough. “What <em>were</em>
these things?”</p>

<p>My sternness was all for his judge, his executioner;
yet it made him avert himself again, and
that movement made <em>me</em>, with a single bound
and an irrepressible cry, spring straight upon
him. For there again, against the glass, as if
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
to blight his confession and stay his answer,
was the hideous author of our woe&mdash;the white
face of damnation. I felt a sick swim at the
drop of my victory and all the return of my
battle, so that the wildness of my veritable leap
only served as a great betrayal. I saw him,
from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination,
and on the perception that even now he
only guessed, and that the window was still to
his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to
convert the climax of his dismay into the very
proof of his liberation. “No more, no more, no
more!” I shrieked, as I tried to press him against
me, to my visitant.</p>

<p>“Is she <em>here</em>?” Miles panted as he caught
with his sealed eyes the direction of my words.
Then as his strange “she” staggered me and,
with a gasp, I echoed it, “Miss Jessel, Miss
Jessel!” he with a sudden fury gave me
back.</p>

<p>I seized, stupefied, his supposition&mdash;some sequel
to what we had done to Flora, but this
made me only want to show him that it was
better still than that. “It’s not Miss Jessel!
But it’s at the window&mdash;straight before us.
It’s <em>there</em>&mdash;the coward horror, there for the last
time!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>At this, after a second in which his head made
the movement of a baffled dog’s on a scent and
then gave a frantic little shake for air and light,
he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring
vainly over the place and missing wholly,
though it now, to my sense, filled the room like
the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence.
“It’s <em>he</em>?”</p>

<p>I was so determined to have all my proof that
I flashed into ice to challenge him. “Whom do
you mean by ‘he’?”</p>

<p>“Peter Quint&mdash;you devil!” His face gave
again, round the room, its convulsed supplication.
“<em>Where?</em>”</p>

<p>They are in my ears still, his supreme surrender
of the name and his tribute to my devotion.
“What does he matter now, my own?&mdash;what
will he <em>ever</em> matter? <em>I</em> have you,” I
launched at the beast, “but he has lost you
for ever!” Then, for the demonstration of my
work, “There, <em>there</em>!” I said to Miles.</p>

<p>But he had already jerked straight round,
stared, glared again, and seen but the quiet day.
With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of
he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over
an abyss, and the grasp with which I recovered
him might have been that of catching him in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
his fall. I caught him, yes, I held him&mdash;it may
be imagined with what a passion; but at the
end of a minute I began to feel what it truly
was that I held. We were alone with the quiet
day, and his little heart, dispossessed, had
stopped.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">At</span> the foot of the staircase he waited and listened,
thinking he had heard her call to him
from the gallery, high aloft but out of view, to
which he had allowed her independent access and
whence indeed, on her first going up, the sound
of her appreciation had reached him in rapid
movements, evident rushes and dashes, and in
droll, charming cries that echoed through the
place. He had afterwards, expectant and restless,
been, for another look, to the house-door,
and then had fidgeted back into the hall, where
her voice again caught him. It was many a day
since such a voice had sounded in those empty
chambers, and never perhaps, in all the years,
for poor Chivers, had any voice at all launched
a note so friendly and so free.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, mum, there ain’t no one whatever
come yet. It’s quite all right, mum,&mdash;you can
please yourself!” If he left her to range, all
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>
his pensive little economy seemed to say, wasn’t
it just his poor pickings? He quitted the stairs,
but stopped again, with his hand to his ear, as
he heard her once more appeal to him. “Lots
of lovely<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>? Lovely <em>what</em>, mum? Little ups
and downs?” he quavered aloft. “Oh, as you
say, mum: as many as in a poor man’s life!”
She was clearly disposed, as she roamed in delight
from point to point, to continue to talk,
and, with his better ear and his scooped hand, he
continued to listen hard. “‘Dear little crooked
steps’? Yes, mum; please mind ’em, mum:
they be cruel in the dark corners!” She appeared
to take another of her light scampers, the
sign of a fresh discovery and a fresh response;
at which he felt his heart warm with the success
of a trust of her that might after all have been
rash. Once more her voice reached him and
once more he gossiped back. “Coming up too?
Not if you’ll kindly indulge me, mum&mdash;I must
be where I can watch the bell. It takes watching
as well as hearing!”&mdash;he dropped, as he
resumed his round, to a murmur of great patience.
This was taken up the next moment by the husky
plaint of the signal itself, which seemed to confess
equally to short wind and creaking joints.
It moved, however, distinguishably, and its motion
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>
made him start much more as if he had been
guilty of sleeping at his post than as if he had
waited half the day. “Mercy, if I <em>didn’t</em> watch<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”
He shuffled across the wide stone-paved
hall and, losing himself beneath the great arch
of the short passage to the entrance-front, hastened
to admit his new visitor. He gives us
thereby the use of his momentary absence for a
look at the place he has left.</p>

<p>This is the central hall, high and square, brown
and grey, flagged beneath and timbered above,
of an old English country-house; an apartment
in which a single survey is a perception of long
and lucky continuities. It would have been difficult
to find elsewhere anything at once so old and
so actual, anything that had plainly come so far,
far down without, at any moment of the endless
journey, losing its way. To stand there and look
round was to wonder a good deal&mdash;yet without
arriving at an answer&mdash;whether it had been most
neglected or most cherished; there was such
resignation in its long survival and yet such
bravery in its high polish. If it had never been
spoiled, this was partly, no doubt, because it had
been, for a century, given up; but what it had
been given up to was, after all, homely and familiar
use. It had in it at the present moment
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>
indeed much of the chill of fallen fortunes; but
there was no concession in its humility and no
hypocrisy in its welcome. It was magnificent
and shabby, and the eyes of the dozen dark old
portraits seemed, in their eternal attention, to
count the cracks in the pavement, the rents in
the seats of the chairs, and the missing tones in
the Flemish tapestry. Above the tapestry, which,
in its turn, was above the high oak wainscot,
most of these stiff images&mdash;on the side on which
it principally reigned&mdash;were placed; and they
held up their heads to assure all comers that a
tone or two was all that <em>was</em> missing, and that
they had never waked up in winter dawns to any
glimmer of bereavement, in the long night, of
any relic or any feature. Such as it was, the company
was all there; every inch of old oak, every
yard of old arras, every object of ornament or of
use to which these surfaces formed so rare a background.
If the watchers on the walls had ever
found a gap in their own rank, the ancient roof,
of a certainty, would have been shaken by their
collective gasp. As a matter of fact it was rich
and firm&mdash;it had almost the dignity of the vault
of a church. On this Saturday afternoon in
August, a hot, still day, such of the casements
as freely worked in the discoloured glass of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
windows stood open in one quarter to a terrace
that overlooked a park and in another to a wonderful
old empty court that communicated with
a wonderful old empty garden. The staircase,
wide and straight, mounted, full in sight, to a
landing that was half-way up; and on the right,
as you faced this staircase, a door opened out of
the brown panelling into a glimpse of a little
morning-room, where, in a slanted, gilded light,
there was brownness too, mixed with notes of old
yellow. On the left, toward court and garden,
another door stood open to the warm air. Still
as you faced the staircase you had at your right,
between that monument and the morning-room,
the arch through which Chivers had disappeared.</p>

<p>His reappearance interrupts and yet in a manner,
after all, quickens our intense impression;
Chivers on the spot, and in this severe but spacious
setting, was so perfect an image of immemorial
domesticity. It would have been
impossible perhaps, however, either to tell his
age or to name his use: he was of the age of
all the history that lurked in all the corners
and of any use whatever you might be so good
as still to find for him. Considerably shrunken
and completely silvered, he had perpetual agreement
in the droop of his kind white head and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>
perpetual inquiry in the jerk of the idle old
hands now almost covered by the sleeves of
the black dress-coat which, twenty years before,
must have been by a century or two the newest
thing in the house and into which his years
appeared to have declined very much as a
shrunken family moves into a part of its habitation.
This attire was completed by a white
necktie that, in honour of the day, he himself
had this morning done up. The humility he
betrayed and the oddity he concealed were alike
brought out by his juxtaposition with the gentleman
he had admitted.</p>

<p>To admit Mr. Prodmore was anywhere and at
any time, as you would immediately have recognised,
an immense admission. He was a personage
of great presence and weight, with a
large smooth face in which a small sharp meaning
was planted like a single pin in the tight
red toilet-cushion of a guest-chamber. He wore
a blue frock-coat and a stiff white waistcoat
and a high white hat that he kept on his head
with a kind of protesting cock, while in his
buttonhole nestled a bold prize plant on which
he occasionally lowered a proprietary eye that
seemed to remind it of its being born to a public
career. Mr. Prodmore’s appearance had evidently
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" title="223"> </a>
been thought out, but it might have
struck you that the old portraits took it in
with a sterner stare, with a fixedness indeed in
which a visitor more sensitive would have read
a consciousness of his remaining, in their presence,
so jauntily, so vulgarly covered. He had
never a glance for them, and it would have been
easy after a minute to see that this was an old
story between them. Their manner, as it were,
sensibly increased the coolness. This coolness
became a high rigour as Mr. Prodmore encountered,
from the very threshold, a disappointment.</p>

<p>“No one here?” he indignantly demanded.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say no one has come, sir,”
Chivers replied; “but I’ve had a telegram from
Captain Yule.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore’s apprehension flared out. “Not
to say he ain’t coming?”</p>

<p>“He was to take the 2.20 from Paddington;
he certainly <em>should</em> be here!” The old man
spoke as if his non-arrival were the most unaccountable
thing in the world, especially for a
poor person ever respectful of the mystery of
causes.</p>

<p>“He should have been here this hour or more.
And so should my fly-away daughter!”</p>

<p>Chivers surrounded this description of Miss
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" title="224"> </a>
Prodmore with the deep discretion of silence,
and then, after a moment, evidently reflected
that silence, in a world bestrewn with traps to
irreverence, might be as rash as speech. “Were
they coming&mdash;a&mdash;together, sir?”</p>

<p>He had scarcely mended the matter, for his
visitor gave an inconsequent stare. “Together?&mdash;for
what do you take Miss Prodmore?” This
young lady’s parent glared about him again as
if to alight on something else that was out of
place; but the good intentions expressed in the
attitude of every object might presently have
been presumed to soothe his irritation. It had
at any rate the effect of bridging, for poor
Chivers, some of his gaps. “It <em>is</em> in a sense
true that their ‘coming together,’ as you call it,
is exactly what I’ve made my plans for today:
my calculation was that we should all punctually
converge on this spot. Attended by her trusty
maid, Miss Prodmore, who happens to be on a
week’s visit to her grandmother at Bellborough,
was to take the 1.40 from that place. I was to
drive over&mdash;ten miles&mdash;from the most convenient
of my seats. Captain Yule”&mdash;the speaker
wound up his statement as with the mention of
the last touch in a masterpiece of his own sketching&mdash;“was
finally to shake off for a few hours
the peculiar occupations that engage him.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" title="225"> </a>The old man listened with his head askance
to favour his good ear, but his visible attention
all on a sad spot in one of the half-dozen worn
rugs. “They <em>must</em> be peculiar, sir, when a gentleman
comes into a property like this and goes
three months without so much as a nat’ral
curiosity<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>! I don’t speak of anything but
what <em>is</em> nat’ral, sir; but there have <em>been</em> people
here<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“There have repeatedly been people here!”
Mr. Prodmore complacently interrupted.</p>

<p>“As you say, sir&mdash;to be shown over. With
the master himself never shown!” Chivers dismally
commented.</p>

<p>“He <em>shall</em> be, so that nobody can miss him!”
Mr. Prodmore, for his own reassurance as well,
hastened to retort.</p>

<p>His companion risked a tiny explanation. “It
will be a mercy indeed to look on him; but I
meant that he has not been taken round.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant too. <em>I’ll</em> take him&mdash;round
and round: it’s exactly what I’ve come
for!” Mr. Prodmore rang out; and his eyes
made the lower circuit again, looking as pleased
as such a pair of eyes could look with nobody
as yet quite good enough either to terrify or to
tickle. “He can’t fail to be affected, though
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" title="226"> </a>
he <em>has</em> been up to his neck in such a different
class of thing.”</p>

<p>Chivers clearly wondered awhile what class of
thing it could be. Then he expressed a timid
hope. “In nothing, I dare say, but what’s right,
sir<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“In everything,” Mr. Prodmore distinctly informed
him, “that’s wrong! But here he is!”
that gentleman added with elation as the doorbell
again sounded. Chivers, under the double
agitation of the appeal and the disclosure, proceeded
to the front as fast as circumstances
allowed; while Mr. Prodmore, left alone, would
have been observed&mdash;had not his solitude been
so bleak&mdash;to recover a degree of cheerfulness.
Cheerfulness in solitude at Covering End was
certainly not irresistible, but particular feelings
and reasons had pitched, for their campaign,
the starched, if now somewhat ruffled, tent of
his large white waistcoat. If they had issued
audibly from that pavilion, they would have
represented to us his consciousness of the reinforcement
he might bring up for attack should
Captain Yule really resist the house. The sound
he next heard from the front caused him none
the less, for that matter, to articulate a certain
drop. “Only Cora?&mdash;Well,” he added in a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" title="227"> </a>
tone somewhat at variance with his “only,” “he
shan’t, at any rate, resist <em>her</em>!” This announcement
would have quickened a spectator’s interest
in the young lady whom Chivers now introduced
and followed, a young lady who straightway
found herself the subject of traditionary discipline.
“I’ve waited. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Cora Prodmore, who had a great deal of colour
in her cheeks and a great deal more&mdash;a bold
variety of kinds&mdash;in the extremely high pitch
of her new, smart clothes, meant, on the whole,
it was easy to see, very little, and met this
challenge with still less show of support either
from the sources I have mentioned or from any
others. A dull, fresh, honest, overdressed damsel
of two-and-twenty, she was too much out
of breath, too much flurried and frightened, to
do more than stammer: “Waited, papa? Oh,
I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>Her regret appeared to strike her father still
more as an impertinence than as a vanity.
“Would you then, if I had not had patience
for you, have wished not to find me? Why the
dickens are you so late?”</p>

<p>Agitated, embarrassed, the girl was at a loss.
“I’ll tell you, papa!” But she followed up her
pledge with an air of vacuity and then, dropping
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" title="228"> </a>
into the nearest seat, simply closed her eyes to
her danger. If she desired relief, she had caught
at the one way to get it. “I feel rather faint.
Could I have some tea?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore considered both the idea and his
daughter’s substantial form. “Well, as I shall
expect you to put forth <em>all</em> your powers&mdash;yes!”
He turned to Chivers. “Some tea.”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes had attached themselves to
Miss Prodmore’s symptoms with more solicitude
than those of her parent. “I did think it might
be required!” Then as he gained the door of
the morning-room: “I’ll lay it out here.”</p>

<p>The young lady, on his withdrawal, recovered
herself sufficiently to rise again. “It was my
train, papa&mdash;so very awfully behind. I walked
up, you know, also, from the station&mdash;there’s
such a lovely footpath across the park.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been roaming the country then
alone?” Mr. Prodmore inquired.</p>

<p>The girl protested with instant eagerness
against any such picture. “Oh, dear no, not
<em>alone</em>!” She spoke, absurdly, as if she had had
a train of attendants; but it was an instant before
she could complete the assurance. “There
were ever so many people about.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is more possible than that there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" title="229"> </a>
should be <em>too</em> many!” said her father, speaking
as for his personal convenience, but presenting
that as enough. “But where, among them all,”
he demanded, “is your trusty maid?”</p>

<p>Cora’s reply made up in promptitude what it
lacked in felicity. “I didn’t bring her.” She
looked at the old portraits as if to appeal to them
to help her to remember why. Apparently indeed
they gave a sign, for she presently went
on: “She was so extremely unwell.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore met this with reprobation.
“Wasn’t she to understand from the first that
we don’t permit<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Anything of that sort?”&mdash;the girl recalled
it at least as a familiar law. “Oh, yes, papa&mdash;I
<em>thought</em> she did.”</p>

<p>“But she doesn’t?”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore pressed
the point. Poor Cora, at a loss again, appeared
to wonder if the point had better be a failure of
brain or of propriety, but her companion continued
to press. “What on earth’s the matter
with her?”</p>

<p>She again communed with their silent witnesses.
“I really don’t quite know, but I think
that at Granny’s she eats too much.”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon put an end to <em>that</em>!” Mr. Prodmore
returned with decision. “You expect then to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_230" title="230"> </a>
pursue your adventures quite into the night&mdash;to
return to Bellborough as you came?”</p>

<p>The girl had by this time begun a little to find
her feet. “Exactly as I came, papa dear,&mdash;under
the protection of a new friend I’ve just made, a
lady whom I met in the train and who is also
going back by the 6.19. She was, like myself, on
her way to this place, and I expected to find her
here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore chilled on the spot any such expectations.
“What does she want at this place?”</p>

<p>Cora was clearly stronger for her new friend
than for herself. “She wants to see it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore reflected on this complication.
“Today?” It was practically presumptuous.
“Today won’t do.”</p>

<p>“So I suggested,” the girl declared. “But do
you know what she said?”</p>

<p>“How should I know,” he coldly demanded,
“what a nobody says?”</p>

<p>But on this, as if with the returning taste of
a new strength, his daughter could categorically
meet him. “She’s not a nobody. She’s an
American.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, for a moment, was struck: he
embraced the place, instinctively, in a flash of
calculation. “An American?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" title="231"> </a>“Yes, and she’s wild<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He knew all about that. “Americans mostly
<em>are</em>!”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said Cora, “to see this place.
‘Wild’ was what she herself called it&mdash;and I
think she also said she was ‘mad.’”</p>

<p>“She gave”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore reviewed the
affair&mdash;“a fine account of herself! But she
won’t do.”</p>

<p>The effect of her new acquaintance on his
companion had been such that she could, after
an instant, react against this sentence. “Well,
when I told her that this particular day perhaps
wouldn’t, she said it would just <em>have</em> to.”</p>

<p>“Have to do?” Mr. Prodmore showed again,
through a chink, his speculative eye. “For <em>what</em>,
then, with such grand airs?”</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose, for what Americans want.”</p>

<p>He measured the quantity. “They want
everything.”</p>

<p>“Then I wonder,” said Cora, “that she hasn’t
arrived.”</p>

<p>“When she does arrive,” he answered, “I’ll
tackle her; and I shall thank you, in future, not
to take up, in trains, with indelicate women of
whom you know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I did know something,” his daughter
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" title="232"> </a>
pleaded; “for I saw her yesterday at Bellborough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore contested even this freedom.
“And what was she doing at Bellborough?”</p>

<p>“Staying at the Blue Dragon, to see the old
abbey. She says she just loves old abbeys. It
seems to be the same feeling,” the girl went on,
“that brought her over, today, to see this old
house.”</p>

<p>“She ‘just loves’ old houses? Then why the
deuce didn’t she accompany you properly, since
she is so pushing, to the door?”</p>

<p>“Because she went off in a fly,” Cora explained,
“to see, first, the old hospital. She just
loves old hospitals. She asked me if this isn’t a
show-house. I told her”&mdash;the girl was anxious
to disclaim responsibility&mdash;“that I hadn’t the
least idea.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em>!” Mr. Prodmore cried almost with ferocity.
“I wonder, on such a speech, what she
thought of <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>Miss Prodmore meditated with distinct humbleness.
“I know. She told me.”</p>

<p>He had looked her up and down. “That
you’re really a hopeless frump?”</p>

<p>Cora, oddly enough, seemed almost to court
this description. “That I’m not, as she rather
funnily called it, a show-girl.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" title="233"> </a>“Think of your having to be reminded&mdash;by
the very strangers you pick up,” Mr. Prodmore
groaned, “of what my daughter should pre-eminently
be! Your friend, all the same,” he
bethought himself, “is evidently loud.”</p>

<p>“Well, when she comes,” the girl again so far
agreed as to reply, “you’ll certainly hear her.
But don’t judge her, papa, till you do. She’s
tremendously clever,” she risked&mdash;“there seems
to be nothing she doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>“And there seems to be nothing you do!
You’re <em>not</em> tremendously clever,” Mr. Prodmore
pursued; “so you’ll permit me to demand of
you a slight effort of intelligence.” Then, as
for the benefit of the listening walls themselves,
he struck the high note. “I’m expecting Captain
Yule.”</p>

<p>Cora’s consciousness blinked. “The owner of
this property?”</p>

<p>Her father’s tone showed his reserves. “That’s
what it depends on you to make him!”</p>

<p>“On me?” the girl gasped.</p>

<p>“He came into it three months ago by the
death of his great-uncle, who had lived to ninety-three,
but who, having quarrelled mortally with
his father, had always refused to receive either
sire or son.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" title="234"> </a>Our young lady bent her eyes on this page
of family history, then raised them but dimly
lighted. “But now, at least, doesn’t he live
here?”</p>

<p>“So little,” her companion replied, “that he
comes here today for the very first time. I’ve
some business to discuss with him that can best
be discussed on this spot; and it’s a vital part
of that business that you too should take pains
to make him welcome.”</p>

<p>Miss Prodmore failed to ignite. “In his own
house?”</p>

<p>“That it’s <em>not</em> his own house is just the point
I seek to make! The way I look at it is that
it’s <em>my</em> house! The way I look at it even, my
dear”&mdash;in his demonstration of his ways of looking
Mr. Prodmore literally expanded&mdash;“is that
it’s <em>our</em> house. The whole thing is mortgaged,
as it stands, for every penny of its value; and
I’m in the pleasant position&mdash;do you follow
me?” he trumpeted.</p>

<p>Cora jumped. “Of holding the mortgages?”</p>

<p>He caught her with a smile of approval and
indeed of surprise. “You keep up with me
better than I hoped. I hold every scrap of
paper, and it’s a precious collection.”</p>

<p>She smothered, perceptibly, a vague female
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" title="235"> </a>
sigh, glancing over the place more attentively
than she had yet done. “Do you mean that
you can come down on him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to ‘come,’ my dear&mdash;I <em>am</em>
‘down.’ <em>This</em> is down!”&mdash;and the iron point
of Mr. Prodmore’s stick fairly struck, as he
rapped it, a spark from the cold pavement. “I
came many weeks ago&mdash;commercially speaking&mdash;and
haven’t since budged from the place.”</p>

<p>The girl moved a little about the hall, then
turned with a spasm of courage. “Are you going
to be very hard?”</p>

<p>If she read the eyes with which he met her she
found in them, in spite of a certain accompanying
show of pleasantry, her answer. “Hard with
<em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;that doesn’t matter. Hard with the
Captain.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore thought an instant. “‘Hard’
is a stupid, shuffling term. What do you mean
by it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t understand business,” Cora
said; “but I think I understand <em>you</em>, papa,
enough to gather that you’ve got, as usual, a
striking advantage.”</p>

<p>“As usual, I <em>have</em> scored; but my advantage
won’t be striking perhaps till I have sent the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" title="236"> </a>
blow home. What I appeal to you, as a father, at
present to do”&mdash;he continued broadly to demonstrate&mdash;“is
to nerve my arm. I look to you to
see me through.”</p>

<p>“Through what, then?”</p>

<p>“Through this most important transaction.
Through the speculation of which you’ve been
the barely dissimulated subject. I’ve brought
you here to receive an impression, and I’ve
brought you, even more, to make one.”</p>

<p>The girl turned honestly flat. “But on whom?”</p>

<p>“On me, to begin with&mdash;by not being a fool.
And then, Miss, on <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>Erect, but as if paralysed, she had the air of
facing the worst. “On Captain Yule?”</p>

<p>“By bringing him to the point.”</p>

<p>“But, father,” she asked in evident anguish&mdash;“to
<em>what</em> point?”</p>

<p>“The point where a gentleman <em>has</em> to.”</p>

<p>Miss Prodmore faltered. “Go down on his
knees?”</p>

<p>Her father considered. “No&mdash;they don’t do
that now.”</p>

<p>“What <em>do</em> they do?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore carried his eyes with a certain
sustained majesty to a remote point. “He will
know himself.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" title="237"> </a>“Oh, no, indeed, he won’t,” the girl cried;
“they don’t <em>ever</em>!”</p>

<p>“Then the sooner they learn&mdash;whoever teaches
’em!&mdash;the better: the better I mean in particular,”
Mr. Prodmore added with an intention discernibly
vicious, “for the master of this house.
I’ll guarantee that he shall understand that,” he
concluded, “for I shall do my part.”</p>

<p>She looked at him as if his part were really to
be hated. “But how on earth, sir, can I ever do
mine? To begin with, you know, I’ve never even
seen him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore took out his watch; then, having
consulted it, put it back with a gesture that
seemed to dispose at the same time and in the
same manner of the objection. “You’ll see him
<em>now</em>&mdash;from one moment to the other. He’s
remarkably handsome, remarkably young, remarkably
ambitious, and remarkably clever. He has
one of the best and oldest names in this part of
the country&mdash;a name that, far and wide here,
one could do so much with that I’m simply indignant
to see him do so little. I propose, my dear,
to do with it all he hasn’t, and I further propose,
to that end, first to get hold of it. It’s you,
Miss Prodmore, who shall take it out of the fire.”</p>

<p>“The fire?”&mdash;he had terrible figures.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" title="238"> </a>“Out of the mud, if you prefer. You must
pick it up, do you see? My plan is, in short,”
Mr. Prodmore pursued, “that when we’ve
brushed it off and rubbed it down a bit, blown
away the dust and touched up the rust, my
daughter shall gracefully bear it.”</p>

<p>She could only oppose, now, a stiff, thick
transparency that yielded a view of the course
in her own veins, after all, however, mingled
with a feebler fluid, of the passionate blood of
the Prodmores. “And pray is it also Captain
Yule’s plan?”</p>

<p>Her father’s face warned her off the ground
of irony, but he replied without violence. “His
plans have not yet quite matured. But nothing
is more natural,” he added with an ominous
smile, “than that they shall do so on the sunny
south wall of Miss Prodmore’s best manner.”</p>

<p>Miss Prodmore’s spirit was visibly rising,
and a note that might have meant warning for
warning sounded in the laugh produced by this
sally. “You speak of them, papa, as if they
were sour little plums! You exaggerate, I
think, the warmth of Miss Prodmore’s nature.
It has always been thought remarkably cold.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll be so good, my dear, as to confound&mdash;it
mightn’t be amiss even a little to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" title="239"> </a>
scandalise&mdash;that opinion. I’ve spent twenty
years in giving you what your poor mother
used to call advantages, and they’ve cost me
hundreds and hundreds of pounds. It’s now
time that, both as a parent and as a man of
business, I should get my money back. I
couldn’t help your temper,” Mr. Prodmore conceded,
“nor your taste, nor even your unfortunate
resemblance to the estimable, but far from
ornamental, woman who brought you forth; but
I paid out a small fortune that you should have,
damn you, don’t you know? a good manner.
You never show it to me, certainly; but do you
mean to tell me that, at this time of day&mdash;for
other persons&mdash;you <em>haven’t</em> got one?”</p>

<p>This pulled our young lady perceptibly up;
there was a directness in the argument that was
like the ache of old pinches. “If you mean by
‘other persons’ persons who are particularly
civil&mdash;well, Captain Yule may not see his way
to be one of them. He may not <em>think</em>&mdash;don’t
you see?&mdash;that I’ve a good manner.”</p>

<p>“Do your duty, Miss, and never mind what
he thinks!” Her father’s conception of her
duty momentarily sharpened. “Don’t look at
him like a sick turkey, and he’ll be sure to
think right.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_240" title="240"> </a>The colour that sprang into Cora’s face at
this rude comparison was such, unfortunately,
as perhaps a little to justify it. Yet she retained,
in spite of her emotion, some remnant
of presence of mind. “I remember your saying
once, some time ago, that that was just what he
would be sure <em>not</em> to do: I mean when he began
to go in for his dreadful ideas<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore took her boldly up. “About
the ‘radical programme,’ the ‘social revolution,’
the spoliation of everyone, and the destruction
of everything? Why, you stupid thing, I’ve
worked round to a complete agreement with
him. The taking from those who have by those
who haven’t<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Well?” said the girl, with some impatience,
as he sought the right way of expressing his
notion.</p>

<p>“What is it but to receive, from consenting
hands, the principal treasure of the rich? If
I’m rich, my daughter is my largest property,
and I freely make her over. I shall, in other
words, forgive my young friend his low opinions
if he renounces them for <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>Cora, at this, started as with a glimpse of delight.
“He won’t renounce them! He <em>shan’t</em>!”</p>

<p>Her father appeared still to enjoy the ingenious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" title="241"> </a>
way he had put it, so that he had good humour
to spare. “If you suggest that you’re in political
sympathy with him, you mean then that you’ll
take him as he <em>is</em>?”</p>

<p>“I won’t take him at all!” she protested with
her head very high; but she had no sooner
uttered the words than the sound of the approach
of wheels caused her dignity to drop.
“A fly?&mdash;it must be <em>he</em>!” She turned right
and left, for a retreat or an escape, but her father
had already caught her by the wrist. “Surely,”
she pitifully panted, “you don’t want me to
bounce on him <em>thus</em>?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, as he held her, estimated the
effect. “Your frock won’t do&mdash;with what it
cost me?”</p>

<p>“It’s not my frock, papa,&mdash;it’s his thinking
I’ve come here for him to see me!”</p>

<p>He let her go and, as she moved away, had
another look for the social value of the view of
her stout back. It appeared to determine him,
for, with a touch of mercy, he passed his word.
“He doesn’t think it, and he shan’t know it.”</p>

<p>The girl had made for the door of the morning-room,
before reaching which she flirted breathlessly
round. “But he knows you want me to
hook him!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_242" title="242"> </a>Mr. Prodmore was already in the parliamentary
attitude the occasion had suggested to him for
the reception of his visitor. “The way to ‘hook’
him will be not to be hopelessly vulgar. He
doesn’t know that you know anything.” The
house-bell clinked, and he waved his companion
away. “Await us there with tea, and mind you
toe the mark!”</p>

<p>Chivers, at this moment, summoned by the bell,
reappeared in the morning-room doorway, and
Cora’s dismay brushed him as he sidled past her
and off into the passage to the front. Then, from
the threshold of her refuge, she launched a last
appeal. “Don’t <em>kill</em> me, father: give me time!”
With which she dashed into the room, closing the
door with a bang.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" title="243"> </a>II</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">Mr. Prodmore</span>, in Chivers’s absence, remained
staring as if at a sudden image of
something rather fine. His child had left with
him the sense of a quick irradiation, and he failed
to see why, at the worst, such lightnings as she
was thus able to dart shouldn’t strike somewhere.
If he had spoken to her of her best
manner perhaps <em>that</em> was her best manner. He
heard steps and voices, however, and immediately
invited to his aid his own, which was
simply magnificent. Chivers, returning, announced
solemnly “Captain Yule!” and ushered
in a tall young man in a darkish tweed
suit and a red necktie, attached in a sailor’s
knot, who, as he entered, removed a soft brown
hat. Mr. Prodmore, at this, immediately saluted
him by uncovering. “Delighted at last to see
you here!”</p>

<p>It was the young man who first, in his comparative
simplicity, put out a hand. “If I’ve
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" title="244"> </a>
not come before, Mr. Prodmore, it was&mdash;very
frankly speaking&mdash;from the dread of seeing
<em>you</em>!” His speech contradicted, to some extent,
his gesture, but Clement Yule’s was an aspect
in which contradictions were rather remarkably
at home. Erect and slender, but as strong as
he was straight, he was set up, as the phrase
is, like a soldier, and yet finished, in certain
details&mdash;matters of expression and suggestion
only indeed&mdash;like a man in whom sensibility
had been recklessly cultivated. He was hard
and fine, just as he was sharp and gentle, just
as he was frank and shy, just as he was serious
and young, just as he looked, though you could
never have imitated it, distinctly “kept up”
and yet considerably reduced. His features
were thoroughly regular, but his complete shaving
might have been designed to show that
they were, after all, not absurd. The face Mr.
Prodmore offered him fairly glowed, on this
new showing, with instant pride of possession,
and there was that in Captain Yule’s whole air
which justified such a sentiment without consciously
rewarding it.</p>

<p>“Ah, surely,” said the elder man, “my presence
is not without a motive!”</p>

<p>“It’s just the motive,” Captain Yule returned,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_245" title="245"> </a>
“that makes me wince at it! Certainly I’ve no
illusions,” he added, “about the ground of our
meeting. Your thorough knowledge of what
you’re about has placed me at your mercy&mdash;you
hold me in the hollow of your hand.”</p>

<p>It was vivid in every inch that Mr. Prodmore’s
was a nature to expand in the warmth,
or even in the chill, of any tribute to his financial
subtlety. “Well, I won’t, on my side, deny
that when, in general, I go in deep I don’t go
in for nothing. I make it pay double!” he
smiled.</p>

<p>“You make it pay so well&mdash;‘double’ surely
doesn’t do you justice!&mdash;that, if I’ve understood
you, you can do quite as you like with
this preposterous place. Haven’t you brought
me down exactly that I may <em>see</em> you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve certainly brought you down that you
may open your eyes!” This, apparently, however,
was not what Mr. Prodmore himself had
arrived to do with his own. These fine points
of expression literally contracted with intensity.
“Of course, you know, you can always clear the
property. You can pay off the mortgages.”</p>

<p>Captain Yule, by this time, had, as he had not
done at first, looked up and down, round about
and well over the scene, taking in, though at a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" title="246"> </a>
mere glance, it might have seemed, more particularly,
the row, high up, of strenuous ancestors.
But Mr. Prodmore’s last words rang none the
less on his ear, and he met them with mild
amusement. “Pay off<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>? What can I pay
off with?”</p>

<p>“You can always raise money.”</p>

<p>“What can I raise it on?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore looked massively gay. “On
your great political future.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve not taken&mdash;for the short run at
least&mdash;the lucrative line,” the young man said,
“and I know what you think of <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore’s blandness confessed, by its
instant increase, to this impeachment. There
was always the glory of intimacy in Yule’s knowing
what he thought. “I hold that you keep, in
public, very dangerous company; but I also hold
that you’re extravagant mainly because you’ve
nothing at stake. A man has the right opinions,”
he developed with pleasant confidence, “as soon
as he has something to lose by having the wrong.
Haven’t I already hinted to you how to set your
political house in order? You drop into the
lower regions because you keep the best rooms
empty. You’re a firebrand, in other words my
dear Captain, simply because you’re a bachelor.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_247" title="247"> </a>
That’s one of the early complaints we all pass
through, but it’s soon over, and the treatment for
it quite simple. I have your remedy.”</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes, wandering again about
the house, might have been those of an auditor of
the fiddling before the rise of the curtain. “A
remedy worse than the disease?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing worse, that I’ve ever heard
of,” Mr. Prodmore sharply replied, “than your
particular fix. Least of all a heap of gold<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“A heap of gold?” His visitor idly settled,
as if the curtain were going up.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore raised it bravely. “In the lap
of a fine fresh lass! Give pledges to fortune, as
somebody says&mdash;<em>then</em> we’ll talk. You want
money&mdash;that’s what you want. Well, marry it!”</p>

<p>Clement Yule, for a little, never stirred, save
that his eyes yet again strayed vaguely. At last
they stopped with a smile. “Of course I could
do that in a moment!”</p>

<p>“It’s even just my own danger from you,” his
companion returned. “I perfectly recognise that
any woman would now jump<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I don’t like jumping women,” Captain Yule
threw in; “but that perhaps is a detail. It’s
more to the point that I’ve yet to see the woman
whom, by an advance of my own<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_248" title="248"> </a>“You’d care to keep in the really attractive
position<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Which can never, of course, be anything”&mdash;Yule
took his friend up again&mdash;“but that of
waiting quietly.”</p>

<p>“Never, never anything!” Mr. Prodmore, most
assentingly, banished all other thought. “But
I haven’t asked you, you know, to make an
advance.”</p>

<p>“You’ve only asked me to receive one?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore waited a little. “Well, I’ve
asked you&mdash;I asked you a month ago&mdash;to think
it all over.”</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> thought it all over,” Clement Yule
said; “and the strange sequel seems to be that
my eyes have got accustomed to my darkness.
I seem to make out, in the gloom of my meditations,
that, at the worst, I can let the whole thing
slide.”</p>

<p>“The property?”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore jerked back
as if it were about to start.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it the property,” his visitor inquired,
“that positively throws me up? If I can afford
neither to live on it nor to disencumber it, I can
at least let it save its own bacon and pay its own
debts. I can say to you simply: ‘Take it, my
dear sir, and the devil take <em>you</em>!’”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_249" title="249"> </a>Mr. Prodmore gave a quick, strained smile.
“You wouldn’t be so shockingly rude!”</p>

<p>“Why not&mdash;if I’m a firebrand and a keeper
of low company and a general nuisance? Sacrifice
for sacrifice, that might very well be the
least!”</p>

<p>This was put with such emphasis that Mr.
Prodmore was for a moment arrested. He could
stop very short, however, and yet talk as still
going. “How do you know, if you haven’t compared
them? It’s just to make the comparison&mdash;in
all the proper circumstances&mdash;that you’re here
at this hour.” He took, with a large, though
vague, exhibitory gesture, a few turns about.
“Now that you stretch yourself&mdash;for an hour’s
relaxation and rocked, as it were, by my friendly
hand&mdash;in the ancient cradle of your race, can
you seriously entertain the idea of parting with
such a venerable family relic?”</p>

<p>It was evident that, as he decorously embraced
the scene, the young man, in spite of this dissuasive
tone, was entertaining ideas. It might have
appeared at the moment to a spectator in whom
fancy was at all alert that the place, becoming in
a manner conscious of the question, felt itself on
its honour, and that its honour could make no
compromise. It met Clement Yule with no grimace
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_250" title="250"> </a>
of invitation, with no attenuation of its rich
old sadness. It was as if the two hard spirits,
the grim <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</i> and the quick modern conscience,
stood an instant confronted. “The cradle
of my race bears, for me, Mr. Prodmore, a striking
resemblance to its tomb.” The sigh that
dropped from him, however, was not quite void
of tenderness. It might, for that matter, have
been a long, sad creak, portending collapse,
of some immemorial support of the Yules.
“Heavens, how melancholy<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, somewhat ambiguously, took up
the sound. “Melancholy?”&mdash;he just balanced.
That well might be, even a little <em>should</em> be&mdash;yet
agreement might depreciate.</p>

<p>“Musty, mouldy;” then with a poke of his
stick at a gap in the stuff with which an old chair
was covered, “mangy!” Captain Yule responded.
“Is this the character throughout?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore fixed a minute the tell-tale
tatter. “You must judge for yourself&mdash;you
must go over the house.” He hesitated again;
then his indecision vanished&mdash;the right line was
clear. “It does look a bit run down, but I’ll tell
you what I’ll do. I’ll do it up for you&mdash;neatly:
I’ll throw <em>that</em> in!”</p>

<p>His young friend turned on him an eye that,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_251" title="251"> </a>
though markedly enlivened by his offer, was
somehow only the more inscrutable. “Will you
put in the electric light?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore’s own twinkle&mdash;at this touch
of a spring he had not expected to work&mdash;was,
on the other hand, temporarily veiled. “Well,
if you’ll meet me half-way! We’re dealing
here”&mdash;he backed up his gravity&mdash;“with
fancy-values. Don’t you feel,” he appealed, “as
you take it all in, a kind of a something-or-other
down your back?”</p>

<p>Clement Yule gazed awhile at one of the
pompous quarterings in the faded old glass that,
in tones as of late autumn, crowned with armorial
figures the top of the great hall-window;
then with abruptness he turned away. “Perhaps
I <em>don’t</em> take it all in; but what I do feel
is&mdash;since you mention it&mdash;a sort of stiffening
of the spine! The whole thing is too queer&mdash;too
cold&mdash;too cruel.”</p>

<p>“Cruel?”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore’s demur was virtuous.</p>

<p>“Like the face of some stuck-up distant relation
who won’t speak first. I see in the stare
of the old dragon, I taste in his very breath, all
the helpless mortality he has tucked away!”</p>

<p>“Lord, sir&mdash;you <em>have</em> fancies!” Mr. Prodmore
was almost scandalised.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_252" title="252"> </a>But the young man’s fancies only multiplied
as he moved, not at all critical, but altogether
nervous, from object to object. “I don’t know
what’s the matter&mdash;but there <em>is</em> more here than
meets the eye.” He tried as for his amusement
or his relief to figure it out. “I miss the old
presences. I feel the old absences. I hear the
old voices. I see the old ghosts.”</p>

<p>This last was a profession that offered some
common ground. “The old ghosts, Captain
Yule,” his companion promptly replied, “are
worth so much a dozen, and with no reduction,
I must remind you&mdash;with the price indeed
rather raised&mdash;for the quantity taken!” Feeling
then apparently that he had cleared the air
a little by this sally, Mr. Prodmore proceeded
to pat his interlocutor on a back that he by no
means wished to cause to be put to the wall.
“Look about you, at any rate, a little more.”
He crossed with his toes well out the line that
divides encouragement from patronage. “Do
make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Mr. Prodmore. May
I light a cigarette?” his visitor asked.</p>

<p>“In your own house, Captain?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the question: it seems so much
less my own house than before I had come into
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_253" title="253"> </a>
it!” The Captain offered Mr. Prodmore a
cigarette which that gentleman, also taking a
light from him, accepted; then he lit his own
and began to smoke. “As I understand you,”
he went on, “you <em>lump</em> your two conditions?
I mean I must accept both or neither?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore threw back his shoulders with
a high recognition of the long stride represented
by this question. “You <em>will</em> accept both, for,
by doing so, you’ll clear the property at a
stroke. The way I put it is&mdash;see?&mdash;that if
you’ll stand for Gossage, you’ll get returned for
Gossage.”</p>

<p>“And if I get returned for Gossage, I shall
marry your daughter. Accordingly,” the young
man pursued, “if I marry your daughter<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I’ll burn up, before your eyes,” said this
young lady’s proprietor, “every scratch of your
pen. It will be a bonfire of signatures. There
won’t be a penny to pay&mdash;there’ll only be a
position to take. You’ll take it with peculiar
grace.”</p>

<p>“Peculiar, Mr. Prodmore&mdash;very!”</p>

<p>The young man had assented more than he
desired, but he was not deterred by it from completing
the picture. “You’ll settle down here in
comfort and honour.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_254" title="254"> </a>Clement Yule took several steps; the effect of
his host was the reverse of soothing; yet the
latter watched his irritation as if it were the
working of a charm. “Are you very sure of
the ‘honour’ if I turn my political coat?”</p>

<p>“You’ll only be turning it back again to the
way it was always worn. Gossage will receive
you with open arms and press you to a heaving
Tory bosom. That bosom”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore followed
himself up&mdash;“has never heaved but to
sound Conservative principles. The cradle, as
I’ve called it,&mdash;or at least the rich, warm coverlet,&mdash;of
your race, Gossage was the political property,
so to speak, of generations of your family.
Stand therefore in the good old interest and
you’ll stand like a lion.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you mean,” Captain Yule laughed,
“that I must first roar like one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>I’ll</em> do the roaring!”&mdash;and Mr. Prodmore
shook his mane. “Leave that to me.”</p>

<p>“Then why the deuce don’t you stand yourself?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore knew so familiarly why! “Because
I’m not a remarkably handsome young man
with the grand old home and the right old name.
Because I’m a different sort of matter altogether.
But if I haven’t these advantages,” he went on,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_255" title="255"> </a>
“you’ll do justice to my natural desire that my
daughter at least shall have them.”</p>

<p>Clement Yule watched himself smoke a minute.
“Doing justice to natural desires is just what, of
late, I’ve tried to make a study of. But I confess
I don’t quite grasp the deep attraction you
appear to discover in so large a surrender of your
interests.”</p>

<p>“My surrenders are my own affair,” Mr. Prodmore
rang out, “and as for my interests, as I
never, on principle, give anything for nothing, I
dare say I may be trusted to know them when
I see them. You come high&mdash;I don’t for a
moment deny it; but when I look at you, in this
pleasant, intimate way, my dear boy&mdash;if you’ll
allow me so to describe things&mdash;I recognise one
of those cases, unmistakeable when really met, in
which one must put down one’s money. There’s
not an article in the whole shop, if you don’t
mind the comparison, that strikes me as better
value. I intend you shall be, Captain,” Mr.
Prodmore wound up in a frank, bold burst, “the
true comfort of my life!”</p>

<p>The young man was as hushed for a little as
if an organ-tone were still in the air. “May I
inquire,” he at last returned, “if Miss Prodmore’s
ideas of comfort are as well defined&mdash;and in her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_256" title="256"> </a>
case, I may add, as touchingly modest&mdash;as her
father’s? Is she a responsible party of this ingenious
arrangement?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore rendered homage&mdash;his appreciation
was marked&mdash;to the elevated character
of his young friend’s scruple. “Miss Prodmore,
Captain Yule, may be perhaps best described as
a large smooth sheet of blank, though gilt-edged,
paper. No image of any tie but the true and
perfect filial has yet, I can answer for it, formed
itself on the considerable expanse. But for that
image to be projected<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I’ve only, in person, to appear?” Yule asked
with an embarrassment that he tried to laugh off.</p>

<p>“And, naturally, in person,” Mr. Prodmore intelligently
assented, “do yourself, as well as the
young lady, justice. Do you remember what you
said when I first, in London, laid the matter before
you?”</p>

<p>Clement Yule did remember, but his amusement
increased. “I think I said it struck me I should
first take a look at&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus delicti</i>.”</p>

<p>“You should first see for yourself what you
had really come into? I was not only eager for
that,” said Mr. Prodmore, “but I’m willing to go
further: I’m quite ready to hear you say that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_257" title="257"> </a>
you think you should also first see the young
lady.”</p>

<p>Captain Yule continued to laugh. “There is
something in that then, since you mention it!”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll find that there’s everything.”
Mr. Prodmore again looked at his watch. “Which
will you take first?”</p>

<p>“First?”</p>

<p>“The young lady or the house?”</p>

<p>His companion, at this, unmistakeably started.
“Do you mean your daughter’s <em>here</em>?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore glowed with consciousness. “In
the morning-room.”</p>

<p>“Waiting for me?”</p>

<p>The tone showed a consternation that Mr. Prodmore’s
was alert to soothe. “Ah, as long, you
know, as you like!”</p>

<p>Yule’s alarm, however, was not assuaged; it
appeared to grow as he stared, much discomposed,
yet sharply thinking, at the door to which
his friend had pointed. “Oh, longer than <em>this</em>,
please!” Then as he turned away: “Do you
mean she knows<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“That she’s here on view?” Mr. Prodmore
hung fire a moment, but was equal to the occasion.
“She knows nothing whatever. She’s as
unconscious as the rose on its stem!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_258" title="258"> </a>His companion was visibly relieved. “That’s
right&mdash;let her remain so! I’ll first take the
house,” said Clement Yule.</p>

<p>“Shall I go round <em>with</em> you?” Mr. Prodmore
asked.</p>

<p>The young man’s reflection was brief. “Thank
you. I’d rather, on the whole, go round alone.”</p>

<p>The old servant who had admitted the gentlemen
came back at this crisis from the morning-room,
looking from under a bent brow and with
much limpid earnestness from one of them to the
other. The one he first addressed had evidently,
though quite unaware of it, inspired him with
a sympathy from which he now took a hint.
“There’s tea on, sir!” he persuasively jerked as
he passed the younger man.</p>

<p>The elder answered. “Then I’ll join my
daughter.” He gained the morning-room door,
whence he repeated with an appropriate gesture&mdash;that
of offering proudly, with light, firm fingers,
a flower of his own celebrated raising&mdash;his
happy formula of Miss Prodmore’s state.
“The rose on its stem!” Scattering petals,
diffusing fragrance, he thus passed out.</p>

<p>Chivers, meanwhile, had rather pointlessly
settled once more in its place some small object
that had not strayed; to whom Clement Yule,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_259" title="259"> </a>
absently watching him, abruptly broke out. “I
say, my friend, what colour is the rose?”</p>

<p>The old man looked up with a dimness that
presently glimmered. “The rose, sir?” He
turned to the open door and the shining day.
“Rather a brilliant<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“A brilliant<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” Yule was interested.</p>

<p>“Kind of old-fashioned red.” Chivers smiled
with the pride of being thus able to testify, but
the next instant his smile went out. “It’s the
only one left&mdash;on the old west wall.”</p>

<p>His visitor’s mirth, at this, quickly enough
revived. “My dear fellow, I’m not alluding to
the sole ornament of the garden, but to the
young lady at present in the morning-room. Do
you happen to have noticed if she’s pretty?”</p>

<p>Chivers stood queerly rueful. “Laws, sir&mdash;it’s
a matter I mostly notice; but isn’t it, at the
same time, sir, a matter&mdash;like&mdash;of taste?”</p>

<p>“Pre-eminently. That’s just why I appeal
with such confidence to yours.”</p>

<p>The old man acknowledged with a flush of
real embarrassment a responsibility he had so
little invited. “Well, sir,&mdash;mine was always
a sort of fancy for something more merry-like.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t merry-like then, poor Miss Prodmore?”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_260" title="260"> </a>
Captain Yule’s attention, however,
dropped before the answer came, and he turned
off the subject with an “Ah, if you come to that,
neither am I! But it doesn’t signify,” he went
on. “What are <em>you</em>?” he more sociably demanded.</p>

<p>Chivers clearly had to think a bit. “Well,
sir, I’m not quite <em>that</em>. Whatever has there
been to make me, sir?” he asked in dim extenuation.</p>

<p>“How in the world do <em>I</em> know? I mean to
whom do you belong?”</p>

<p>Chivers seemed to scan impartially the whole
field. “If you could just only <em>tell</em> me, sir! I
quite seem to waste away&mdash;for someone to
take an order of.”</p>

<p>Clement Yule, by this time, had become aware
he was amusing. “Who pays your wages?”</p>

<p>“No one at all, sir,” said the old man very
simply.</p>

<p>His friend, fumbling an instant in a waistcoat
pocket, produced something that his hand, in
obedience to a little peremptory gesture and by
a trick of which he had unlearned, through scant
custom, the neatness, though the propriety was
instinctive, placed itself in a shy practical relation
to. “Then there’s a sovereign. And I haven’t
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_261" title="261"> </a>
many!” the young man, turning away resignedly,
threw after it.</p>

<p>Chivers, for an instant, intensely studied him.
“Ah, then, shouldn’t it stay in the family?”</p>

<p>Clement Yule wheeled round, first struck, then,
at the sight of the figure made by his companion
in this offer, visibly touched. “I think it does,
old boy.”</p>

<p>Chivers kept his eyes on him now. “I’ve
served your house, sir.”</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“All my life.”</p>

<p>So, for a time, they faced each other, and something
in Chivers made Yule at last speak. “Then
I won’t give <em>you</em> up!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I hope you won’t give up anything.”</p>

<p>The Captain took up his hat. “It remains to
be seen.” He looked over the place again; his
eyes wandered to the open door. “Is that the
garden?”</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em>!”&mdash;and the old man’s sigh was like
the creak of the wheel of time. “Shall I show
you how it used to be?”</p>

<p>“It’s just as it <em>is</em>, alas, that I happen to require
it!” Captain Yule reached the door and stood
looking beyond. “Don’t come,” he then said;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_262" title="262"> </a>
“I want to think.” With which he walked
out.</p>

<p>Chivers, left alone, appeared to wonder at it,
and his wonder, like that of most old people, lay
near his lips. “What does he want, poor dear,
to think about?” This speculation, however,
was immediately checked by a high, clear voice
that preceded the appearance on the stairs, before
she had reached the middlemost landing,
of the wonderful figure of a lady, a lady who,
with the almost trumpeted cheer of her peremptory
but friendly call&mdash;“Housekeeper, Butler,
old Family Servant!”&mdash;fairly waked the sleeping
echoes. Chivers gazed up at her in quick
remembrance, half dismayed, half dazzled, of a
duty neglected. She appeared now; she shone
at him out of the upper dusk; reaching the
middle, she had begun to descend, with beautiful
laughter and rustling garments; and though she
was alone she gave him the sense of coming in a
crowd and with music. “Oh, I should have told
him of <em>her</em>!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_263" title="263"> </a>III</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">She</span> was indeed an apparition, a presence
requiring announcement and explanation just in
the degree in which it seemed to show itself in
a relation quite of its own to all social preliminaries.
It evidently either assumed them to
be already over or wished to forestall them
altogether; what was clear at any rate was
that it allowed them scant existence. She was
young, tall, radiant, lovely, and dressed in a
manner determined at once, obviously, by the
fact and by the humour of her journey&mdash;it
might have proclaimed her so a pilgrim or so
set her up as a priestess. Most journeys, for
this lady, at all events, were clearly a brush of
Paris. “Did you think I had got snapped
down in an old box like that poor girl&mdash;what’s
her name? the one who was poking round too&mdash;in
the celebrated poem? You dear, delightful
man, why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Tell you, mum<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Well, that you’re so perfectly&mdash;perfect!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_264" title="264"> </a>
You’re ever so much better than anyone has
ever said. Why, in the name of common sense,
has nobody ever said <em>anything</em>? You’re everything
in the world you ought to be, and not
the shade of a shade of anything you oughtn’t!”</p>

<p>It was a higher character to be turned out
with than poor Chivers had ever dreamed.
“Well, mum, I try!” he gaped.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you don’t&mdash;that’s just your charm!
<em>I</em> try,” cried his friend, “but you do nothing:
here you simply <em>are</em>&mdash;you can’t help it!”</p>

<p>He stood overwhelmed. “Me, mum?”</p>

<p>She took him in at the eyes&mdash;she could take
everything at once. “Yes, you too, you positive
old picture! I’ve seen the old masters&mdash;but
you’re the old master!”</p>

<p>“The master&mdash;I?” He fairly fell back.</p>

<p>“‘The good and faithful servant’&mdash;Rembrandt
van Rhyn: with three stars. <em>That’s</em> what you
are!” Nothing would have been more droll
to a spectator than her manner of meeting his
humbleness, or more charming indeed than the
practical sweetness of her want of imagination
of it. “The house is a vision of beauty, and
you’re simply worthy of the house. I can’t say
more for you!”</p>

<p>“I find it a bit of a strain, mum,” Chivers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_265" title="265"> </a>
candidly replied, “to keep up&mdash;fairly to call it&mdash;with
what you <em>do</em> say.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what everyone finds it!”&mdash;she
broke into the happiest laugh. “Yet I haven’t
come here to suffer in silence, you know&mdash;to
suffer, I mean, from envy and despair.” She
was in constant movement, from side to side,
observing, comparing, returning, taking notes
while she gossiped and gossiping, too, for
remembrance. The intention of remembrance
even had in it, however, some prevision of failure
or some alloy of irritation. “You’re so
fatally right and so deadly complete, all the
same, that I can really scarcely bear it: with
every fascinating feature that I had already
heard of and thought I was prepared for, and
ever so many others that, strange to say, I
hadn’t and wasn’t, and that you just spring
right <em>at</em> me like a series of things going off.
What do you call it,” she asked&mdash;“a royal
salute, a hundred guns?”</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm had a bewildering form, but
it had by this time warmed the air, and the old
man rubbed his hands as over a fire to which
the bellows had been applied. “I saw as soon
as you arrived, mum, that you were looking for
more things than ever <em>I</em> heard tell of!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" title="266"> </a>“Oh, I had got you by heart,” she returned,
“from books and drawings and photos; I had
you in my pocket when I came: so, you see, as
soon as you were so good as to give me my
head and let me loose, I knew my way about.
It’s all here, every inch of it,” she competently
continued, “and now at last I can do what I
want!”</p>

<p>A light of consternation, at this, just glimmered
in Chivers’s face. “And pray, mum,
what might that be?”</p>

<p>“Why, take you right back with me&mdash;to
Missoura Top.”</p>

<p>This answer seemed to fix his bewilderment,
but he was there for the general convenience.</p>

<p>“Do I understand you, mum, that you require
to take <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>Her particular convenience, on the spot, embraced
him, so new and delightful a sense had
he suddenly read into her words. “Do you
mean to say you’d come&mdash;as the old Family
Servant? Then <em>do</em>, you nice real thing: it’s
just what I’m dying for&mdash;an old Family Servant!
You’re somebody’s else, yes&mdash;but everything,
over here, is somebody’s else, and I want,
too, a first-rate second-hand one, all ready made,
as you are, but not too much done up. You’re
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_267" title="267"> </a>
the best I’ve seen yet, and I wish I could have
you packed&mdash;put up in paper and bran&mdash;as
I shall have my old pot there.” She whisked
about, remembering, recovering, eager: “Don’t
let me <em>forget</em> my precious pot!” Excited, with
quick transitions, she quite sociably appealed
to her companion, who shuffled sympathetically
to where, out of harm, the object had been
placed on a table. “Don’t you just love old
crockery? That’s awfully sweet old Chelsea.”</p>

<p>He took up the piece with tenderness, though,
in his general agitation, not perhaps with all
the caution with which, for daily service, he
handled ancient frailties. He at any rate turned
on this fresh subject an interested, puzzled eye.
“Where is it I’ve known this very bit&mdash;though
not to say, as <em>you</em> do, by name?” Suddenly
it came to him. “In the pew-opener’s front
parlour!”</p>

<p>“No,” his interlocutress cried, “in the pew-opener’s
best bedroom: on the old chest of
drawers, you know&mdash;with those ducks of brass
handles. I’ve got the handles too&mdash;I mean the
whole thing; and the brass fender and fire-irons,
and the chair her grandmother died in.
Not in the fly,” she added&mdash;“it was such a
bore that they have to be sent.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" title="268"> </a>Chivers, with the pot still in his hands, fairly
rocked in the high wind of so much confidence
and such great transactions. He had nothing
for these, however, but approval. “You did
right to take this out, mum, when the fly went
to the stables. Them flymen do be cruel rash
with anything that’s delicate.” Of the delicacy
of the vessel it now rested with him to deposit
safely again he was by this time so appreciatively
aware that in returning with it to its
safe niche he stumbled into some obscure trap
literally laid for him by his nervousness. It
was the matter of a few seconds, of a false
movement, a knock of the elbow, a gasp, a shriek,
a complete little crash. There was the pot on
the pavement, in several pieces, and the clumsy
cup-bearer blue with fear. “Mercy <em>on</em> us, mum,&mdash;I’ve
brought shame on my old grey hairs!”</p>

<p>The little shriek of his companion had smothered
itself in the utterance, and the next minute,
with the ruin between them, they were
contrastedly face to face. The charming
woman, who had already found more voices in
the air than anyone had found before, could,
in the happy play of this power, find a poetry
in her accident. “Oh, but the way you <em>take</em>
it!” she laughed&mdash;“you’re too quaint to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" title="269"> </a>
live!” She looked at him as if he alone had
suffered&mdash;as if his suffering indeed positively
added to his charm. “The way you said that
now&mdash;it’s just the very ‘type’! That’s all I
want of you now&mdash;to <em>be</em> the very type. It’s
what you are, you poor dear thing&mdash;for you
<em>can’t</em> help it; and it’s what everything and
everyone else is, over here; so that you had
just better all make up your minds to it and
not try to shirk it. There was a type in the
train with me&mdash;the ‘awfully nice girl’ of all
the English novels, the ‘simple maiden in her
flower’ of&mdash;who is it?&mdash;your great poet. <em>She</em>
couldn’t help it either&mdash;in fact I wouldn’t have
<em>let</em> her!” With this, while Chivers picked up
his fragments, his lady had a happy recall. His
face, as he stood there with the shapeless elements
of his humiliation fairly rattling again
in his hands, was a reflection of her extraordinary
manner of enlarging the subject, or
rather, more beneficently perhaps, the space that
contained it. “By the way, the girl was coming
right here. Has she come?”</p>

<p>Chivers crept solemnly away, as if to bury
his dead, which he consigned, with dumb rites,
to a situation of honourable publicity; then, as
he came back, he replied without elation: “Miss
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" title="270"> </a>
Prodmore is here, mum. She’s having her
tea.”</p>

<p>This, for his friend, was a confirmatory touch
to be fitted with eagerness into the picture.
“Yes, that’s exactly it&mdash;they’re always having
their tea!”</p>

<p>“With Mr. Prodmore&mdash;in the morning-room,”
the old man supplemented. “Captain Yule’s in
the garden.”</p>

<p>“Captain Yule?”</p>

<p>“The new master. He’s also just arrived.”</p>

<p>The wonderful lady gave an immediate “Oh!”
to the effect of which her silence for another moment
seemed to add. “She didn’t tell me about
<em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>“Well, mum,” said Chivers, “it do be a
strange thing to tell. He had never&mdash;like,
mum&mdash;so much as seen the place.”</p>

<p>“Before today&mdash;his very own?” This too,
for the visitor, was an impression among impressions,
and, like most of her others, it ended
after an instant as a laugh. “Well, I hope he
likes it!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen many, mum,” Chivers boldly
declared, “that like it as much as <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>She made with her handsome head a motion
that appeared to signify still deeper things than
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" title="271"> </a>
he had caught. Her beautiful wondering eyes
played high and low, like the flight of an imprisoned
swallow, then, as she sank upon a seat,
dropped at last as if the creature were bruised
with its limits. “I should like it still better if
it were <em>my</em> very own!”</p>

<p>“Well, mum,” Chivers sighed, “if it wasn’t
against my duty I could wish indeed it were!
But the Captain, mum,” he conscientiously added,
“is the lawful heir.”</p>

<p>It was a wonder what she found in whatever
he said; he touched with every word the spring
of her friendly joy. “That’s another of your
lovely old things&mdash;I adore your lawful heirs!”
She appeared to have, about everything that
came up, a general lucid vision that almost glorified
the particular case. “He has come to take
possession?”</p>

<p>Chivers accepted, for the credit of the house,
this sustaining suggestion. “He’s a-taking of it
now.”</p>

<p>This evoked, for his companion, an instantaneous
show. “What does he do and how does he
do it? Can’t I <em>see</em>?” She was all impatience,
but she dropped to disappointment as her guide
looked blank. “There’s no grand fuss<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“I scarce think him, mum,” Chivers with propriety
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" title="272"> </a>
hastened to respond, “the gentleman to
make any about anything.”</p>

<p>She had to resign herself, but she smiled as she
thought. “Well, perhaps I like them better
when they don’t!” She had clearly a great
range of taste, and it all came out in the wistfulness
with which, before the notice apparently
served on her, she prepared to make way. “I
also”&mdash;she lingered and sighed&mdash;“have taken
possession!”</p>

<p>Poor Chivers really rose to her. “It was you,
mum,” he smiled, “took it first!”</p>

<p>She sadly shook her head. “Ah, but for a
poor little hour! <em>He’s</em> for life.”</p>

<p>The old man gave up, after a little, with equal
depression, the pretence of dealing with such
realities. “For mine, mum, I do at least hope.”</p>

<p>She made again the circuit of the great place,
picking up without interest the jacket she had on
her previous entrance laid down. “I shall think
of you, you know, here together.” She vaguely
looked about her as for anything else to take;
then abruptly, with her eyes again on Chivers:
“Do you suppose he’ll be kind to you?”</p>

<p>His hand, in his trousers-pocket, seemed to
turn the matter over. “He has already been,
mum.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_273" title="273"> </a>“Then be sure to be so to <em>him</em>!” she replied
with some emphasis. The house-bell sounded as
she spoke, giving her quickly another thought.
“Is that his bell?”</p>

<p>Chivers was hardly less struck. “I must see
whose!”&mdash;and hurrying, on this, to the front,
he presently again vanished.</p>

<p>His companion, left alone, stood a minute with
an air in which happy possession was oddly and
charmingly mingled with desperate surrender;
so much as to have left you in doubt if the next
of her lively motions were curiosity or disgust.
Impressed, in her divided state, with a small
framed plaque of enamel, she impulsively detached
it from the wall and examined it with
hungry tenderness. Her hovering thought was
so vivid that you might almost have traced it in
sound. “Why, bless me if it isn’t Limoges! I
wish awfully I were a <em>bad</em> woman: then, I do
devoutly hope, I’d just quietly take it!” It
testified to the force of this temptation that
on hearing a sound behind her she started like
a guilty thing; recovering herself, however, and&mdash;just,
of course, not to appear at fault&mdash;keeping
the object familiarly in her hand as she
jumped to a recognition of the gentleman who,
coming in from the garden, had stopped in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" title="274"> </a>
the open doorway. She gathered indeed from
his being there a positive advantage, the full confidence
of which was already in her charming
tone. “Oh, Captain Yule, I’m delighted to meet
you! It’s such a comfort to ask you if I <em>may</em>!”</p>

<p>His surprise kept him an instant dumb, but
the effort not too closely to betray it appeared
in his persuasive inflection. “If you ‘may,’
madam<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Why, just <em>be</em> here, don’t you know? and
poke round!” She presented such a course as
almost vulgarly natural. “Don’t tell me I can’t
now, because I already <em>have</em>: I’ve been upstairs
and downstairs and in my lady’s chamber&mdash;I
won’t answer for it even perhaps that I’ve not
been in my lord’s! I got round your lovely
servant&mdash;if you don’t look out I’ll grab him.
If you don’t look out, you know, I’ll grab everything.”
She gave fair notice and went on with
amazing serenity; she gathered positive gaiety
from his frank stupefaction. “That’s what I
came over for&mdash;just to lay your country waste.
Your house is a wild old dream; and besides”&mdash;she
dropped, oddly and quaintly, into real
responsible judgment&mdash;“you’ve got some quite
good things. Oh, yes, you <em>have</em>&mdash;several: don’t
coyly pretend you haven’t!” Her familiarity
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_275" title="275"> </a>
took these flying leaps, and she alighted, as her
victim must have phrased it to himself, without
turning a hair. “Don’t you <em>know</em> you have?
Just look at that!” She thrust her enamel before
him, but he took it and held it so blankly,
with an attention so absorbed in the mere woman,
that at the sight of his manner her zeal for his
interest and her pity for his detachment again
flashed out. “Don’t you know <em>anything</em>? Why,
it’s Limoges!”</p>

<p>Clement Yule simply broke into a laugh&mdash;though
his laugh indeed was comprehensive.
“It seems absurd, but I’m not in the least acquainted
with my house. I’ve never happened
to see it.”</p>

<p>She seized his arm. “Then do let me show
it to you!”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted.” His laughter had
redoubled in a way that spoke of his previous
tension; yet his tone, as he saw Chivers return
breathless from the front, showed that he had
responded sincerely enough to desire a clear
field. “Who in the world’s there?”</p>

<p>The old man was full of it. “A party!”</p>

<p>“A party?”</p>

<p>Chivers confessed to the worst. “Over from
Gossage&mdash;to see the house.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_276" title="276"> </a>The worst, however, clearly, was quite good
enough for their companion, who embraced the
incident with sudden enthusiasm. “Oh, let <em>me</em>
show it!” But before either of the men could
reply she had, addressing herself to Chivers, one
of those droll drops that betrayed the quickness
of her wit and the freedom of her fancy. “Dear
me, I forgot&mdash;<em>you</em> get the tips! But, you dear
old creature,” she went on, “I’ll get them, too,
and I’ll simply make them over to you.” She
again pressed Yule&mdash;pressed him into this service.
“Perhaps they’ll be bigger&mdash;for me!”</p>

<p>He continued to be highly amused. “I
should think they’d be enormous&mdash;for you!
But I <em>should</em> like,” he added with more concentration&mdash;“I
should like extremely, you know,
to go over with you alone.”</p>

<p>She was held a moment. “Just you and me?”</p>

<p>“Just you and me&mdash;as you kindly proposed.”</p>

<p>She stood reminded; but, throwing it off, she
had her first inconsequence. “That must be for
after<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but not too late.” He looked at his
watch. “I go back tonight.”</p>

<p>“Laws, sir!” Chivers irrepressibly groaned.</p>

<p>“You want to keep him?” the stranger asked.
Captain Yule turned away at the question, but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_277" title="277"> </a>
her look went after him, and she found herself,
somehow, instantly answered. “Then I’ll help
you,” she said to Chivers; “and the oftener we
go over the better.”</p>

<p>Something further, on this, quite immaterial,
but quite adequate, passed, while the young
man’s back was turned, between the two others;
in consequence of which Chivers again appealed
to his master. “Shall I show them straight in, sir?”</p>

<p>His master, still detached, replied without
looking at him. “By all means&mdash;if there’s
money in it!” This was jocose, but there would
have been, for an observer, an increase of hope
in the old man’s departing step. The lady had
exerted an influence.</p>

<p>She continued, for that matter, with a start
of genial remembrance, to exert one in his absence.
“Oh, and I promised to show it to Miss
Prodmore!” Her conscience, with a kind smile
for the young person she named, put the question
to Clement Yule. “Won’t you call her?”</p>

<p>The coldness of his quick response made it
practically none. “‘Call’ her? Dear lady, I
don’t <em>know</em> her!”</p>

<p>“You must, then&mdash;she’s wonderful.” The
face with which he met this drew from the dear
lady a sharper look; but, for the aid of her good-nature,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_278" title="278"> </a>
Cora Prodmore, at the moment she spoke,
presented herself in the doorway of the morning-room.
“See? She’s charming!” The girl, with
a glare of recognition, dashed across the open as
if under heavy fire; but heavy fire, alas&mdash;the
extremity of exposure&mdash;was promptly embodied
in her friend’s public embrace. “Miss Prodmore,”
said this terrible friend, “let me present
Captain Yule.” Never had so great a gulf been
bridged in so free a span. “Captain Yule, Miss
Prodmore. Miss Prodmore, Captain Yule.”</p>

<p>There was stiffness, the cold mask of terror,
in such notice as either party took of this demonstration,
the convenience of which was not
enhanced for the divided pair by the perception
that Mr. Prodmore had now followed his daughter.
Cora threw herself confusedly into it indeed,
as with a vain rebound into the open.
“Papa, let me ‘present’ you to Mrs. Gracedew.
Mrs. Gracedew, Mr. Prodmore. Mr. Prodmore,
Mrs. Gracedew.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, with a free salute and a distinct
repetition, took in Mr. Prodmore as she had
taken everything else. “Mr. Prodmore”&mdash;oh,
she pronounced him, spared him nothing of himself.
“So happy to meet your daughter’s father.
Your daughter’s so perfect a specimen.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_279" title="279"> </a>Mr. Prodmore, for the first moment, had simply
looked large and at sea; then, like a practical man
and without more question, had quickly seized the
long perch held out to him in this statement.
“So perfect a specimen, yes!”&mdash;he seemed to
pass it on to his young friend.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, if she observed his emphasis,
drew from it no deterrence; she only continued
to cover Cora with a gaze that kept her well in
the middle. “So fresh, so quaint, so droll!”</p>

<p>It was apparently a result of what had passed
in the morning-room that Mr. Prodmore had
grasped afresh the need for effective action, which
he clearly felt he did something to meet in clutching
precipitately the helping hand popped so suddenly
out of space, yet so beautifully gloved and so
pressingly and gracefully brandished. “So fresh,
so quaint, so droll!”&mdash;he again gave Captain
Yule the advantage of the stranger’s impression.</p>

<p>To what further appreciation this might have
prompted the lady herself was not, however, just
then manifest; for the return of Chivers had been
almost simultaneous with the advance of the
Prodmores, and it had taken place with forms that
made it something of a circumstance. There was
positive pomp in the way he preceded several persons
of both sexes, not tourists at large, but simple
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_280" title="280"> </a>
sightseers of the half-holiday order, plain provincial
folk already, on the spot, rather awestruck.
The old man, with suppressed pulls and prayers,
had drawn them up in a broken line, and the habit
of more peopled years, the dull drone of the dead
lesson, sounded out in his prompt beginning. The
party stood close, in this manner, on one side of
the apartment, while the master of the house and
his little circle were grouped on the other. But
as Chivers, guiding his squad, reached the centre
of the space, Mrs. Gracedew, markedly moved,
quite unreservedly engaged, came slowly forward
to meet him. “This, ladies and gentlemen,” he
mechanically quavered, “is perhaps the most
important feature&mdash;the grand old feudal, baronial
’all. Being, from all accounts, the most ancient
portion of the edifice, it was erected in the very
earliest ages.” He paused a moment, to mark his
effect, then gave a little cough which had become,
obviously, in these great reaches of time, an
essential part of the trick. “Some do say,” he
dispassionately remarked, “in the course of the
fifteenth century.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, who had visibly thrown herself
into the working of the charm, following him with
vivid sympathy and hanging on his lips, took the
liberty, at this, of quite affectionately pouncing on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" title="281"> </a>
him. “<em>I</em> say in the fourteenth, my dear&mdash;you’re
robbing us of a hundred years!”</p>

<p>Her victim yielded without a struggle. “I do
seem, in them dark old centuries, sometimes to
trip a little.” Yet the interruption of his ancient
order distinctly discomposed him, all the more that
his audience, gaping with a sense of the importance
of the fine point, moved in its mass a little nearer.
Thus put upon his honour, he endeavoured to
address the group with a dignity undiminished.
“The Gothic roof is much admired, but the west
gallery is a modern addition.”</p>

<p>His discriminations had the note of culture, but
his candour, all too promptly, struck Mrs. Gracedew
as excessive. “What in the name of Methuselah
do you call ‘modern’? It was here at the
visit of James the First, in 1611, and is supposed
to have served, in the charming detail of its ornament,
as a model for several that were constructed
in his reign. The great fireplace,” she handsomely
conceded, “<em>is</em> Jacobean.”</p>

<p>She had taken him up with such wondrous
benignant authority&mdash;as if, for her life, if they
<em>were</em> to have it, she couldn’t help taking care
that they had it out; she had interposed with
an assurance that so converted her&mdash;as by the
wave of a great wand, the motion of one of her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_282" title="282"> </a>
own free arms&mdash;from mere passive alien to
domesticated dragon, that poor Chivers could
only assent with grateful obeisances. She so
plunged into the old book that he had quite
lost his place. The two gentlemen and the
young lady, moreover, were held there by the
magic of her manner. His own, as he turned
again to his cluster of sightseers, took refuge
in its last refinement. “The tapestry on the
left Italian&mdash;the elegant wood-work Flemish.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was upon him again. “Excuse
me if I just deprecate a misconception.
The elegant wood-work Italian&mdash;the tapestry
on the left Flemish.” Suddenly she put it to
him before them all, pleading as familiarly and
gaily as she had done when alone with him, and
looking now at the others, all round, gentry
and poor folk alike, for sympathy and support.
She had an idea that made her dance. “Do
you really mind if <em>I</em> just do it? Oh, I know
how: I can do quite beautifully the housekeeper
last week at Castle Gaunt.” She fraternised
with the company as if it were a game
they must play with her, though this first stage
sufficiently hushed them. “How do you do?
Ain’t it thrilling?” Then with a laugh as free
as if, for a disguise, she had thrown her handkerchief
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_283" title="283"> </a>
over her head or made an apron of
her tucked-up skirt, she passed to the grand
manner. “Keep well together, please&mdash;we’re
not doing puss-in-the-corner. I’ve my duty to
all parties&mdash;I can’t be partial to one!”</p>

<p>The contingent from Gossage had, after all,
like most contingents, its spokesman&mdash;a very
erect little personage in a very new suit and a
very green necktie, with a very long face and
upstanding hair. It was on an evident sense
of having been practically selected for encouragement
that he, in turn, made choice of a
question which drew all eyes. “How many
parties, now, can you manage?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was superbly definite. “Two.
The party up and the party down.” Chivers
gasped at the way she dealt with this liberty,
and his impression was conspicuously deepened
as she pointed to one of the escutcheons in the
high hall-window. “Observe in the centre compartment
the family arms.” She did take his
breath away, for before he knew it she had
crossed with the lightest but surest of gestures
to the black old portrait, on the opposite wall,
of a long-limbed gentleman in white trunk-hose.
“And observe the family legs!” Her
method was wholly her own, irregular and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_284" title="284"> </a>
broad; she flew, familiarly, from the pavement
to the roof and then dropped from the roof to
the pavement as if the whole air of the place
were an element in which she floated. “Observe
the suit of armour worn at Tewkesbury&mdash;observe
the tattered banner carried at Blenheim.”
They bobbed their heads wherever she pointed,
but it would have come home to any spectator
that they saw her alone. This was the case
quite as much with the opposite trio&mdash;the case
especially with Clement Yule, who indeed made
no pretence of keeping up with her signs. It
was the signs themselves he looked at&mdash;not at
the subjects indicated. But he never took his
eyes from her, and it was as if, at last, she had
been peculiarly affected by a glimpse of his attention.
All her own, for a moment, frankly went
back to him and was immediately determined by
it. “Observe, above all, that you’re in one of
the most interesting old houses, of its type, in
England; for which the ages have been tender
and the generations wise: letting it change so
slowly that there’s always more left than taken&mdash;living
their lives in it, but letting it shape
their lives!”</p>

<p>Though this pretty speech had been unmistakeably
addressed to the younger of the temporary
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_285" title="285"> </a>
occupants of Covering End, it was the elder who,
on the spot, took it up. “A most striking and
appropriate tribute to a real historical monument!”
Mr. Prodmore had a natural ease that
could deal handsomely with compliments, and
he manifestly, moreover, like a clever man, saw
even more in such an explosion of them than
fully met the ear. “You do, madam, bring the
whole thing out!”</p>

<p>The visitor who had already with such impunity
ventured had, on this, a loud renewal of boldness,
but for the benefit of a near neighbour.
“Doesn’t she indeed, Jane, bring it out?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, with a friendly laugh, caught
the words in their passage. “But who in the
world wants to keep it <em>in</em>? It isn’t a secret&mdash;it
isn’t a strange cat or a political party!” The
housekeeper, as she talked, had already dropped
from her; her sense of the place was too fresh
for control, though instead of half an hour it
might have taken six months to become so fond.
She soared again, at random, to the noble spring
of the roof. <ins title="Just">“Just</ins> look at those lovely lines!”
They all looked, all but Clement Yule, and
several of the larger company, subdued, overwhelmed,
nudged each other with strange sounds.
Wherever she turned Mrs. Gracedew appeared
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_286" title="286"> </a>
to find a pretext for breaking out. “Just look
at the tone of that glass, and the gilding of that
leather, and the cutting of that oak, and the
dear old flags of the very floor.” It came back,
came back easily, her impulse to appeal to the
lawful heir, and she seemed, with her smile of
universal intelligence, just to demand the charity
of another moment for it. “To look, in this
place, is to love!”</p>

<p>A voice from the party she had in hand took
it up with an artless guffaw that resounded
more than had doubtless been meant and that,
at any rate, was evidently the accompaniment
of some private pinch applied to one of the ladies.
“I <em>say</em>&mdash;to love!”</p>

<p>It was one of the ladies who very properly
replied. “It depends on who you look at!”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, in the geniality of the hour,
made his profit of the simple joke. “Do you
hear <em>that</em>, Captain? You must look at the right
person!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew certainly had not been looking
at the wrong one. “I don’t think Captain Yule
cares. He doesn’t do justice<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>Though her face was still gay, she had faltered,
which seemed to strike the young man even more
than if she had gone on. “To what, madam?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_287" title="287"> </a>Well, on the chance she let him have it. “To
the value of your house.”</p>

<p>He took it beautifully. “I like to hear <em>you</em>
express it!”</p>

<p>“I <em>can’t</em> express it!” She once more looked
all round, and so much more gravely than she had
yet done that she might have appeared in trouble.
She tried but, with a sigh, broke down. “It’s too
inexpressible!”</p>

<p>This was a view of the case to which Mr. Prodmore,
for his own reasons, was not prepared to
assent. Expression and formulation were what
he naturally most desired, and he had just encountered
a fountain of these things that he
couldn’t prematurely suffer to fail him. “Do
what you can for it, madam. It would bring it
quite home.”</p>

<p>Thus excited, she gave with sudden sombre
clearness another try. “Well&mdash;the value’s a
fancy value!”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, receiving it as more than he
could have hoped, turned triumphant to his young
friend. “Exactly what I told you!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew explained indeed as if Mr. Prodmore’s
triumph was not perhaps exactly what she
had argued for. Still, the truth was too great.
“When a thing’s unique, it’s unique!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_288" title="288"> </a>That was every bit Mr. Prodmore required.
“It’s unique!”</p>

<p>This met, moreover, the perception of the gentleman
in the green necktie. “It’s unique!”
They all, in fact, demonstratively&mdash;almost vociferously
now&mdash;caught the point.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, finding herself so sustained,
and still with her eyes on the lawful heirs, put it
yet more strongly. “It’s worth anything you
like.”</p>

<p>What was this but precisely what Mr. Prodmore
had always striven to prove? “Anything
you like!” he richly reverberated.</p>

<p>The pleasant discussion and the general interest
seemed to bring them all together. “Twenty
thousand now?” one of the gentlemen from Gossage
archly inquired&mdash;a very young gentleman
with an almost coaxing voice, who blushed immensely
as soon as he had spoken.</p>

<p>He blushed still more at the way Mrs. Gracedew
faced him. “I wouldn’t <em>look</em> at twenty
thousand!”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, on the other hand, was proportionately
uplifted. “She wouldn’t look at twenty
thousand!” he announced with intensity to the
Captain.</p>

<p>The visitor who had been the first to speak
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_289" title="289"> </a>
gave a shrewder guess. “Thirty, then, as it
stands?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked more and more responsible;
she communed afresh with the place; but
she too evidently had her conscience. “It would
be giving it away!”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, at this, could scarcely contain
himself. “It would be giving it away!”</p>

<p>The second speaker had meanwhile conceived
the design of showing that, though still crimson,
he was not ashamed. “You’d hold out for
forty<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew required a minute to answer&mdash;a
very marked minute during which the whole
place, pale old portraits and lurking old echoes
and all, might have made you feel how much
depended on her; to the degree that the consciousness
in her face became finally a reason for
her not turning it to Gossage. “Fifty thousand,
Captain Yule, is what I think I should propose.”</p>

<p>If the place had seemed to listen it might
have been the place that, in admiring accents
from the gentleman with the green tie, took up
the prodigious figure. “Fifty thousand pound!”</p>

<p>It was echoed in a high note from the lady
he had previously addressed. “Fifty thousand!”</p>

<p>Yet it was Mr. Prodmore who caught it up
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" title="290"> </a>
loudest and appeared to make it go furthest.
“Fifty thousand&mdash;fifty thousand!” Mrs. Gracedew
had put him in such spirits that he found
on the spot, indicating to her his young friend,
both the proper humour and the proper rigour
for any question of what anyone might “propose.”
“He’ll never part with the dear old
home!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew could match at least the confidence.
“Then I’ll go over it again while I
have the chance.” Her own humour enjoined
that she should drop into the housekeeper, in
the perfect tone of which character she addressed
herself once more to the party. “We now pass
to the grand staircase.” She gathered her band
with a brave gesture, but before she had fairly
impelled them to the ascent she heard herself
rather sharply challenged by Captain Yule, who,
during the previous scene, had uttered no sound,
yet had remained as attentive as he was impenetrable.
“Please let them pass without you!”</p>

<p>She was taken by surprise. “And stay here
with <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll be so good. I want to speak to
you.” Turning then to Chivers and frowning
on the party, he delivered himself for the first
time as a person in a position. “For God’s
sake, remove them!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" title="291"> </a>The old man, at this blast of impatience, instantly
fluttered forward. “We now pass to
the grand staircase.”</p>

<p>They all passed, Chivers covering their scattered
ascent as a shepherd scales a hillside with
his flock; but it became evident during the
manœuvre that Cora Prodmore was quite out
of tune. She had been standing beyond and
rather behind Captain Yule; but she now moved
quickly round and reached her new friend’s right.
“Mrs. Gracedew, may <em>I</em> speak to you?”</p>

<p>Her father, before the reply could come, had
taken up the place. “<em>After</em> Captain Yule, my
dear.” He was in a state of positively polished
lucidity. “You must make the most&mdash;don’t
you see?&mdash;of the opportunity of the others!”</p>

<p>He waved her to the staircase as one who
knew what he was about, but, while the young
man, turning his back, moved consciously and
nervously away, the girl renewed her effort to
provoke Mrs. Gracedew to detain her. It happened,
to her sorrow, that this lady appeared
for the moment, to the detriment of any free
attention, to be absorbed in Captain Yule’s manner;
so that Cora could scarce disengage her
without some air of invidious reference to it.
Recognising as much, she could only for two
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" title="292"> </a>
seconds, but with great yearning, parry her own
antagonist. “She’ll <em>help</em> me, I think, papa!”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what strikes me, love!” he
cheerfully replied. “But <em>I’ll</em> help you too!”
He gave her, toward the stairs, a push proportioned
both to his authority and to her weight;
and while she reluctantly climbed in the wake of
the visitors, he laid on Mrs. Gracedew’s arm, with
a portentous glance at Captain Yule, a hand of
commanding significance. “Just pile it on!”</p>

<p>Her attention came back&mdash;she seemed to see.
“He doesn’t like it?”</p>

<p>“Not half enough. Bring him round.”</p>

<p>Her eyes rested again on their companion, who
had fidgeted further away and who now, with
his hands in his pockets and unaware of this
private passage, stood again in the open doorway
and gazed into the grey court. Something
in the sight determined her. “I’ll bring him
round.”</p>

<p>But at this moment Cora, pausing half-way up,
sent down another entreaty. “Mrs. Gracedew,
will you see <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>The charming woman looked at her watch.
“In ten minutes,” she smiled back.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, bland and assured, looked at his
own. “You could put him through in five&mdash;but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_293" title="293"> </a>
I’ll allow you twenty. There!” he decisively
cried to his daughter, whom he quickly rejoined
and hustled on her course. Mrs. Gracedew
kissed after her a hand of vague comfort.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" title="294"> </a>IV</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> silence that reigned between the pair
might have been registered as embarrassing had
it lasted a trifle longer. Yule had continued to
turn his back, but he faced about, though he was
distinctly grave, in time to avert an awkwardness.
“How do you come to know so much about
my house?”</p>

<p>She was as distinctly not grave. “How do
<em>you</em> come to know so little?”</p>

<p>“It’s not my fault,” he said very gently. “A
particular combination of misfortunes has forbidden
me, till this hour, to come within a mile of
it.”</p>

<p>These words evidently struck her as so exactly
the right ones to proceed from the lawful
heir that such a felicity of misery could only
quicken her interest. He was plainly as good in
his way as the old butler&mdash;the particular combination
of misfortunes corresponded to the lifelong
service. Her interest, none the less, in its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_295" title="295"> </a>
turn, could only quicken her pity, and all her
emotions, we have already seen, found prompt
enough expression. What could any expression
do indeed now but mark the romantic reality?
“Why, you poor thing!”&mdash;she came toward
him on the weary road. “Now that you’ve got
here I hope at least you’ll stay.” Their intercourse
must pitch itself&mdash;so far as she was
concerned&mdash;in some key that would make up
for things. “Do make yourself comfortable.
Don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>Yule looked a shade less serious. “That’s
exactly what I wanted to say to <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>She was struck with the way it came in.
“Well, if you <em>had</em> been haughty, I shouldn’t
have been quite crushed, should I?”</p>

<p>The young man’s gravity, at this, completely
yielded. “I’m never haughty&mdash;oh, no!”</p>

<p>She seemed even more amused. “Fortunately
then, as <em>I’m</em> never crushed. I don’t think,”
she added, “that I’m really as crushable as you.”</p>

<p>The smile with which he received this failed
to conceal completely that it was something of
a home thrust. “Aren’t we really <em>all</em> crushable&mdash;by
the right thing?”</p>

<p>She considered a little. “Don’t you mean
rather by the wrong?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" title="296"> </a>He had got, clearly, a trifle more accustomed
to her being extraordinary. “Are you sure we
always know them apart?”</p>

<p>She weighed the responsibility. “I always
do. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not quite every time!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she replied, “I don’t think, thank
goodness, we have positively ‘every time’ to distinguish.”</p>

<p>“Yet we must always act,” he objected.</p>

<p>She turned this over; then with her wonderful
living look, “I’m glad to hear it,” she exclaimed,
“because, I fear, I always <em>do</em>! You’ll
certainly think,” she added with more gravity,
“that I’ve taken a line today!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that of mistress of the house?
Yes&mdash;you do seem in possession!”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> don’t!” she honestly answered; after
which, as to attenuate a little the rigour of the
charge: “You don’t comfortably look it, I
mean. You don’t look”&mdash;she was very serious&mdash;“as
I want you to.”</p>

<p>It was when she was most serious that she
was funniest. “How do you ‘want’ me to
look?”</p>

<p>She endeavoured, while he watched her, to
make up her mind, but seemed only, after an
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_297" title="297"> </a>
instant, to recognise a difficulty. “When you
look at <em>me</em>, you’re all right!” she sighed. It
was an obstacle to her lesson, and she cast her
eyes about. “Look at that chimneypiece.”</p>

<p>“Well<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” he inquired as his eyes came
back from it.</p>

<p>“You mean to say it isn’t lovely?”</p>

<p>He returned to it without passion&mdash;gave a
vivid sign of mere disability. “I’m sure I
don’t know. I don’t mean to say anything.
I’m a rank outsider.”</p>

<p>It had an instant effect on her&mdash;she almost
pounced upon him. “Then you must let me
put you up!”</p>

<p>“Up to what?”</p>

<p>“Up to everything!”&mdash;his levity added to
her earnestness. “You were smoking when
you came in,” she said as she glanced about.
“Where’s your cigarette?”</p>

<p>The young man appreciatively produced another.
“I thought perhaps I mightn’t&mdash;here.”</p>

<p>“You may everywhere.”</p>

<p>He bent his head to the information. “Everywhere.”</p>

<p>She laughed at his docility, yet could only
wish to presume upon it. “It’s a rule of the
house!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_298" title="298"> </a>He took in the place with greater pleasure.
“What delightful rules!”</p>

<p>“How could such a house have any others?”&mdash;she
was already launched again in her brave
relation to it. “I <em>may</em> go up just once more&mdash;mayn’t
I&mdash;to the long gallery?”</p>

<p>How could he tell? “The long gallery?”</p>

<p>With an added glow she remembered. “I
forgot you’ve never seen it. Why, it’s the leading
thing about you!” She was full, on the
spot, of the pride of showing it. “Come
right up!”</p>

<p>Clement Yule, half seated on a table from
which his long left leg nervously swung, only
looked at her and smiled and smoked. “There’s
a party up.”</p>

<p>She remembered afresh. “So <em>we</em> must be the
party down? Well, you must give me a chance.
That long gallery’s the principal thing I came
over for.”</p>

<p>She was strangest of all when she explained.
“Where in heaven’s name did you come over
from?”</p>

<p>“Missoura Top, where I’m building&mdash;just in
this style. I came for plans and ideas,” Mrs.
Gracedew serenely pursued. “I felt I must look
right <em>at</em> you.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_299" title="299"> </a>“But what did you know about us?”</p>

<p>She kept it a moment as if it were too good
to give him all at once. “Everything!”</p>

<p>He seemed indeed almost afraid to touch it.
“At ‘Missoura Top’?”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s a growing place&mdash;forty
thousand the last census.” She hesitated; then
as if her warrant should be slightly more personal:
“My husband left it to me.”</p>

<p>The young man presently changed his posture.
“You’re a widow?”</p>

<p>Nothing was wanting to the simplicity of her
quiet assent. “A very lone woman.” Her face,
for a moment, had the vision of a long distance.
“My loneliness is great enough to want something
big to hold it&mdash;and my taste good enough
to want something beautiful. You see, I had
your picture.”</p>

<p>Yule’s innocence made a movement. “Mine?”</p>

<p>Her smile reassured him; she nodded toward
the main entrance. “A water colour I chanced
on in Boston.”</p>

<p>“In Boston?”</p>

<p>She stared. “Haven’t you heard of Boston
either?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but what has Boston heard of <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t ‘you,’ unfortunately&mdash;it was your
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_300" title="300"> </a>
divine south front. The drawing struck me so
that I got you up&mdash;in the books.”</p>

<p>He appeared, however, rather comically, but
half to make it out, or to gather at any rate
that there was even more of it than he feared.
“Are we in the books?”</p>

<p>“Did you never discover it?” Before his
blankness, the dim apprehension in his fine
amused and troubled face of how much there
was of it, her frank, gay concern for him sprang
again to the front. “Where in heaven’s name,
Captain Yule, have <em>you</em> come over from?”</p>

<p>He looked at her very kindly, but as if scarce
expecting her to follow. “The East End of
London.”</p>

<p>She had followed perfectly, he saw the next
instant, but she had by no means equally accepted.
“What were you doing there?”</p>

<p>He could only put it, though a little over-consciously,
very simply. “Working, you see.
When I left the army&mdash;it was much too slow,
unless one was personally a whirlwind of war&mdash;I
began to make out that, for a fighting
man<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“There’s always,” she took him up, “somebody
or other to go for?”</p>

<p>He considered her, while he smoked, with more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_301" title="301"> </a>
confidence; as if she might after all understand.
“The enemy, yes&mdash;everywhere in force. I went
for <em>him</em>: misery and ignorance and vice&mdash;injustice
and privilege and wrong. Such as you see
me<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“You’re a rabid reformer?”&mdash;she understood
beautifully. “I wish we had you at Missoura
Top!”</p>

<p>He literally, for a moment, in the light of her
beauty and familiarity, appeared to measure his
possible use there; then, looking round him
again, announced with a sigh that, predicament
for predicament, his own would do. “I fear my
work is nearer home. I hope,” he continued,
“since you’re so good as to seem to care, to perform
a part of that work in the next House of
Commons. My electors have wanted me<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“And you’ve wanted <em>them</em>,” she lucidly put
in, “and that has been why you couldn’t come
down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for all this last time. And before that,
from my childhood up, there was another reason.”
He took a few steps away and brought it out as
rather a shabby one. “A family feud.”</p>

<p>She proved to be quite delighted with it.
“Oh, I’m so glad&mdash;I <em>hoped</em> I’d strike a ‘feud’!
That rounds it off, and spices it up, and, for the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_302" title="302"> </a>
heartbreak with which I take leave of you, just
neatly completes the fracture!” Her reference
to her going seemed suddenly, on this, to bring
her back to a sense of proportion and propriety,
and she glanced about once more for some wrap
or reticule. This, in turn, however, was another
recall. “Must I really wait&mdash;to go up?”</p>

<p>He had watched her movement, had changed
colour, had shifted his place, had tossed away,
plainly unwitting, a cigarette but half smoked;
and now he stood in her path to the staircase as
if, still unsatisfied, he abruptly sought a way to
turn the tables. “Only till you tell me this: if
you absolutely meant, awhile ago, that this old
thing is so precious.”</p>

<p>She met his doubt with amazement and his
density with compassion. “Do you literally
need I should <em>say</em> it? Can you stand here and
not feel it?” If he had the misfortune of bandaged
eyes, she could at least rejoice in her own
vision, which grew intenser with her having to
speak for it. She spoke as with a new rush of
her impression. “It’s a place to love<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”
Yet to say the whole thing was not easy.</p>

<p>“To love<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” he impatiently insisted.</p>

<p>“Well, as you’d love a person!” If that was
saying the whole thing, saying the whole thing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_303" title="303"> </a>
could only be to go. A sound from the “party
up” came down at that moment, and she took it
so clearly as a call that, for a sign of separation,
she passed straight to the stairs. “Good-bye!”</p>

<p>The young man let her reach the foot, but
then, though the greatest width of the hall now
divided them, spoke, anxiously and nervously, as
if the point she had just made brought them still
more together. “I think I ‘feel’ it, you know;
but it’s simply you&mdash;your presence, as I may
say, and the remarkable way you put it&mdash;that
make me. I’m afraid that in your absence<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”
He struck a match to smoke again.</p>

<p>It gave her time apparently to make out something
to pause for. “In my absence?”</p>

<p>He lit his cigarette. “I may come back<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Come back?” she took him almost sharply
up. “I should like to see you <em>not</em>!”</p>

<p>He smoked a moment. “I mean to my old
idea<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>She had quite turned round on him now.
“Your old idea<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>He faced her over the width still between
them. “Well&mdash;that one <em>could</em> give it up.”</p>

<p>Her stare, at this, fairly filled the space.
“Give up Covering? How in the world&mdash;or
why?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_304" title="304"> </a>“Because I can’t afford to keep it.”</p>

<p>It brought her straight back, but only half-way:
she pulled up short as at a flash. “Can’t
you let it?”</p>

<p>Again he smoked before answering. “Let it
to <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>She gave a laugh, and her laugh brought her
nearer. “I’d take it in a minute!”</p>

<p>Clement Yule remained grave. “I shouldn’t
have the face to charge you a rent that would
make it worth one’s while, and I think even you,
dear lady”&mdash;his voice just trembled as he risked
that address&mdash;“wouldn’t have the face to offer
me one.” He paused, but something in his aspect
and manner checked in her now any impulse
to read his meaning too soon. “My lovely inheritance
is Dead Sea fruit. It’s mortgaged for
all it’s worth and I haven’t the means to pay
the interest. If by a miracle I could scrape the
money together, it would leave me without a
penny to live on.” He puffed his cigarette
profusely. “So if I find the old home at last&mdash;I
lose it by the same luck!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew had hung upon his words, and
she seemed still to wait, in visible horror, for
something that would improve on them. But
when she had to take them for his last, “I never
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_305" title="305"> </a>
heard of anything so awful!” she broke out.
“Do you mean to say you can’t arrange<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he promptly replied, “an arrangement&mdash;if
that be the name to give it&mdash;has been
definitely proposed to me.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, then?”&mdash;she had dropped
into relief. “For heaven’s sake, you poor thing,
definitely accept it!”</p>

<p>He laughed, though with little joy, at her
sweet simplifications. “I’ve made up my mind
in the last quarter of an hour that I can’t. It’s
such a peculiar case.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew frankly wondered; her bias
was clearly sceptical. “<em>How</em> peculiar<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>He found the measure difficult to give. “Well&mdash;more
peculiar than most cases.”</p>

<p>Still she was not satisfied. “More peculiar
than mine?”</p>

<p>“Than yours?”&mdash;Clement Yule knew nothing
about that.</p>

<p>Something, at this, in his tone, his face&mdash;it
might have been his “British” density&mdash;seemed
to pull her up. “I forgot&mdash;you don’t know
mine. No matter. What <em>is</em> yours?”</p>

<p>He took a few steps in thought. “Well, the
fact that I’m asked to change.”</p>

<p>“To change what?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_306" title="306"> </a>He wondered how he could put it; then at
last, on his own side, simplified. “My attitude.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”&mdash;she was relieved again.
“Well, you’re not a statue.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not a statue; but on the other hand,
don’t you see? I’m not a windmill.” There
was good-humour, none the less, in his rigour.
“The mortgages I speak of have all found their
way, like gregarious silly sheep, into the hands
of one person&mdash;a devouring wolf, a very rich, a
very sharp man of money. He holds me in this
manner at his mercy. He consents to make
things comfortable for me, but he requires that,
in return, I shall do something for him that&mdash;don’t
you know?&mdash;rather sticks in my crop.”</p>

<p>It appeared on this light showing to stick for
a moment even in Mrs. Gracedew’s. “Do you
mean something wrong?”</p>

<p>He had not a moment’s hesitation. “Exceedingly
so!”</p>

<p>She turned it over as if pricing a Greek Aldus.
“Anything immoral?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I may literally call it immoral.”</p>

<p>She courted, however, frankly enough, the
strict truth. “Too bad to tell?”</p>

<p>He indulged in another pensive fidget, then
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_307" title="307"> </a>
left her to judge. “He wants me to give
up<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” Yet again he faltered.</p>

<p>“To give up what?” What could it be, she
appeared to ask, that was barely nameable?</p>

<p>He quite blushed to her indeed as he came to
the point. “My fundamental views.”</p>

<p>She was disappointed&mdash;she had waited for
more. “Nothing but <em>them</em>?”</p>

<p>He met her with astonishment. “Surely
they’re quite enough, when one has unfortunately”&mdash;he
rather ruefully smiled&mdash;“so very
many!”</p>

<p>She laughed aloud; this was frankly so odd
a plea. “Well, <em>I’ve</em> a neat collection too, but
I’d ‘swap,’ as they say in the West, the whole
set<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” She looked about the hall for something
of equivalent price; after which she
pointed, as it caught her eye, to the great cave
of the fireplace. “I’d take <em>that</em> set!”</p>

<p>The young man scarcely followed. “The fire-irons?”</p>

<p>“For the whole fundamental lot!” She
gazed with real yearning at the antique group.
“<em>They’re</em> three hundred years old. Do you
mean to tell me your wretched ‘views’<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Have anything like that age? No, thank
God,” Clement Yule laughed, “my views&mdash;wretched
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_308" title="308"> </a>
as you please!&mdash;are quite in their
prime! They’re a hungry little family that
has got to be fed. They keep me awake at
night.”</p>

<p>“Then you must make up your sleep!” Her
impatience grew with her interest. “Listen to
<em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>“That would scarce be the way!” he returned.
But he added more sincerely: “You must surely
see a fellow can’t chuck his politics.”</p>

<p>“‘Chuck’ them<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;sacrifice them.”</p>

<p>“I’d sacrifice mine,” she cried, “for that old
fire-back with your arms!” He glanced at the
object in question, but with such a want of intelligence
that she visibly resented it. “See
how it has stood!”</p>

<p>“See how <em>I’ve</em> stood!” he answered with
spirit. “I’ve glowed with a hotter fire than
anything in any chimney, and the warmth and
light I diffuse have attracted no little attention.
How can I consent to reduce them to
the state of that desolate hearth?”</p>

<p>His companion, freshly struck with the fine
details of the desolation, had walked over to
the chimney-corner, where, lost in her deeper
impression, she lingered and observed. At last
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_309" title="309"> </a>
she turned away with her impatience controlled.
“It’s magnificent!”</p>

<p>“The fire-back?”</p>

<p>“Everything&mdash;everywhere. I don’t understand
your haggling.”</p>

<p>He hesitated. “That’s because you’re ignorant.”
Then seeing in the light of her eye
that he had applied to her the word in the language
she least liked, he hastened to attenuate.
“I mean of what’s behind my reserves.”</p>

<p>She was silent in a way that made their talk
more of a discussion than if she had spoken.
“What <em>is</em> behind them?” she presently asked.</p>

<p>“Why, my whole political history. Everything
I’ve said, everything I’ve done. My
scorching addresses and letters, reproduced in
all the papers. I needn’t go into details, but
I’m a pure, passionate, pledged Radical.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked him full in the face.
“Well, what if you <em>are</em>?”</p>

<p>He broke into mirth at her tone. “Simply
this&mdash;that I can’t therefore, from one day to
the other, pop up at Gossage in the purple
pomp of the opposite camp. There’s a want of
transition. It may be timid of me&mdash;it may
be abject. But I can’t.”</p>

<p>If she was not yet prepared to contest she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_310" title="310"> </a>
was still less prepared to surrender it, and she
confined herself for the instant to smoothing
down with her foot the corner of an old rug.
“Have you thought very much about it?”</p>

<p>He was vague. “About what?”</p>

<p>“About what Mr. Prodmore wants you to
do.”</p>

<p>He flushed up. “Oh, then, you know it’s
<em>he</em>?”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” she said, still gravely enough, “of
an intelligence absolutely infantile.”</p>

<p>“You’re the cleverest Tory I’ve ever met!”
he laughed. “I didn’t mean to mention my
friend’s name, but since <em>you’ve</em> done so<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”
He gave up with a shrug his scruple.</p>

<p>Oh, she had already cleared the ground of
it! “It’s he who’s the devouring wolf? It’s
he who holds your mortgages?”</p>

<p>The very lucidity of her interest just checked
his assent. “He holds plenty of others, and
he treats me very handsomely.”</p>

<p>She showed of a sudden an inconsequent
face. “Do you call <em>that</em> handsome&mdash;such a
condition?”</p>

<p>He shed surprise. “Why, I thought it was
just the condition you could meet.”</p>

<p>She measured her inconsistency, but was not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_311" title="311"> </a>
abashed. “We’re not talking of what <em>I</em> can
meet.” Yet she found also a relief in dropping
the point. “Why doesn’t he stand himself?”</p>

<p>“Well, like other devouring wolves, he’s not
personally adored.”</p>

<p>“Not even,” she asked, “when he offers such
liberal terms?”</p>

<p>Clement Yule had to explain. “I dare say he
doesn’t offer them to everyone.”</p>

<p>“Only to you?”&mdash;at this she quite sprang.
“You <em>are</em> personally adored; you will be still
more if you stand; and that, you poor lamb, is
why he wants you!”</p>

<p>The young man, obviously pleased to find her
after all more at one with him, accepted gracefully
enough the burden her sympathy imposed.
“I’m the bearer of my name, I’m the representative
of my family; and to my family and my
name&mdash;since you’ve led me to it&mdash;this countryside
has been for generations indulgently
attached.”</p>

<p>She listened to him with a sentiment in her
face that showed how now, at last, she felt herself
deal with the lawful heir. She seemed to perceive
it with a kind of passion. “You do of
course what you will with the countryside!”</p>

<p>“Yes”&mdash;he went with her&mdash;“if we do it as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_312" title="312"> </a>
genuine Yules. I’m obliged of course to grant
you that your genuine Yule’s a Tory of Tories.
It’s Mr. Prodmore’s belief that I should carry
Gossage in that character, but in that character
only. They won’t look at me in any other.”</p>

<p>It might have taxed a spectator to say in what
character Mrs. Gracedew, on this, for a little, considered
him. “Don’t be too sure of people’s not
looking at you!”</p>

<p>He blushed again, but he laughed. “We must
leave out my personal beauty.”</p>

<p>“We can’t!” she replied with decision.
“Don’t we take in Mr. Prodmore’s?”</p>

<p>Captain Yule was not prepared. “You call
him beautiful?”</p>

<p>“Hideous.” She settled it; then pursued her
investigation. “What’s the extraordinary interest
that he attaches<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“To the return of a Tory?” Here the young
man <em>was</em> prepared. “Oh, his desire is born of
his fear&mdash;his terror on behalf of Property, which
he sees, somehow, with an intensely Personal,
with a quite colossal ‘P.’ He has a great deal of
that article, and very little of anything else.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, accepting provisionally his demonstration,
had one of her friendly recalls. “Do
you call that nice daughter ‘very little’?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_313" title="313"> </a>The young man looked quite at a loss. “Is she
very big? I really didn’t notice her&mdash;and moreover
she’s just a part of the Property. He thinks
things are going too far.”</p>

<p>She sat straight down on a stiff chair; on
which, with high distinctness: “Well, they <em>are</em>!”</p>

<p>He stood before her in the discomposure of her
again thus appearing to fail him. “Aren’t you
then a lover of justice?”</p>

<p>“A passionate one!” She sat there as upright
as if she held the scales. “Where’s the justice of
your losing this house?” Generous as well as
strenuous, all her fairness thrown out by her dark
old high-backed seat, she put it to him as from
the judicial bench. “To keep Covering, you
must carry Gossage!”</p>

<p>The odd face he made at it might have betrayed
a man dazzled. “As a renegade?”</p>

<p>“As a genuine Yule. What business have you
to be anything else?” She had already arranged
it all. “You must close with Mr. Prodmore&mdash;you
must stand in the Tory interest.” She hung
fire a moment; then as she got up: “If you will,
I’ll conduct your canvass!”</p>

<p>He stared at the distracting picture. “That
puts the temptation high!”</p>

<p>But she brushed the mere picture away. “Ah,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_314" title="314"> </a>
don’t look at me as if <em>I</em> were the temptation!
Look at this sweet old human home, and feel all
its gathered memories. Do you want to know
what they do to me?” She took the survey herself
again, as if to be really sure. “They speak
to me for Mr. Prodmore.”</p>

<p>He followed with a systematic docility the direction
of her eyes, but as if with the result only
of its again coming home to him that there was
no accounting for what things might do. “Well,
there are others than these, you know,” he good-naturedly
pleaded&mdash;“things for which I’ve spoken,
repeatedly and loudly, to others than you.” The
very manner of his speaking on such occasions
appeared, for that matter, now to come back to
him. “One’s ‘human home’ is all very well, but
the rest of one’s humanity is better!” She gave,
at this, a droll soft wail; she turned impatiently
away. “I see you’re disgusted with me, and I’m
sorry; but one must take one’s self as circumstances
and experience have made one, and <ins title="its">it’s</ins>
not my fault, don’t you know? if they’ve made
me a very modern man. I see something else in
the world than the beauty of old show-houses and
the glory of old show-families. There are thousands
of people in England who can show no
houses at all, and I don’t feel it utterly shameful
to share their poor fate!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_315" title="315"> </a>She had moved away with impatience, and it
was the advantage of this for her that the back
she turned prevented him from seeing how intently
she listened. She seemed to continue to
listen even after he had stopped; but if that
gave him a sense of success, he might have been
checked by the way she at last turned round with
a sad and beautiful headshake. “We share the
poor fate of humanity whatever we do, and we do
something to help and console when we’ve something
precious to show. What on earth is more
precious than what the ages have slowly wrought?
They’ve trusted us, in such a case, to keep it&mdash;to
do something, in our turn, for <em>them</em>.” She
shone out at him as if her contention had the
evidence of the noonday sun, and yet in her generosity
she superabounded and explained. “It’s
such a virtue, in anything, to have lasted; it’s
such an honour, for anything, to have been spared.
To all strugglers from the wreck of time hold out
a pitying hand!”</p>

<p>Yule, on this argument,&mdash;of a strain which
even a good experience of debate could scarce have
prepared him to meet,&mdash;had not a congruous rejoinder
absolutely pat, and his hesitation unfortunately
gave him time to see how soon his
companion made out that what had touched him
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_316" title="316"> </a>
most in it was her particular air in presenting it.
She would manifestly have preferred he should
have been floored by her mere moral reach; yet
he was aware that his own made no great show as
he took refuge in general pleasantry. “What a
plea for looking backward, dear lady, to come
from Missoura Top!”</p>

<p>“We’re making a Past at Missoura Top as fast
as ever we can, and I should like to see you lay
your hand on an hour of the one we’ve made! It’s
a tight fit, as yet, I grant,” she said, “and that’s
just why I like, in yours, to find room, don’t you
see? to turn round. You’re <em>in</em> it, over here, and
you can’t get out; so just make the best of that
and treat the thing as part of the fun!”</p>

<p>“The whole of the fun, to me,” the young man
replied, “is in hearing you defend it! It’s like
your defending hereditary gout or chronic rheumatism
and sore throat&mdash;the things I feel aching
in every old bone of these walls and groaning in
every old draught that, I’m sure, has for centuries
blown through them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked as if no woman could be
shaken who was so prepared to be just all round.
“If there be aches&mdash;there may be&mdash;you’re here
to soothe them, and if there be draughts&mdash;there
<em>must</em> be!&mdash;you’re here to stop them up. And
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_317" title="317"> </a>
do you know what <em>I’m</em> here for? If I’ve come
so far and so straight, I’ve almost wondered myself.
I’ve felt with a kind of passion&mdash;but now
I see <em>why</em> I’ve felt.” She moved about the hall
with the excitement of this perception, and, separated
from him at last by a distance across which
he followed her discovery with a visible suspense,
she brought out the news. “I’m here for an act
of salvation&mdash;I’m here to avert a sacrifice!”</p>

<p>So they stood a little, with more, for the
minute, passing between them than either really
could say. She might have flung down a glove
that he decided on the whole, passing his hand
over his head as the seat of some confusion, not
to pick up. Again, but flushed as well as smiling,
he sought the easiest cover. “You’re here,
I think, madam, to be a memory for all my
future!”</p>

<p>Well, she was willing, she showed as she came
nearer, to take it, at the worst, for that. “You’ll
be one for mine, if I can see you by that hearth.
Why do you make such a fuss about changing
your politics? If you’d come to Missoura Top,
you’d change them quick enough!” Then, as
she saw further and struck harder, her eyes grew
deep, her face even seemed to pale, and she paused,
splendid and serious, with the force of her plea.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_318" title="318"> </a>
“What do politics amount to, compared with
religions? Parties and programmes come and go,
but a duty like this abides. There’s nothing you
can break with”&mdash;she pressed him closer, ringing
out&mdash;“that would be like breaking <em>here</em>. The
very words are violent and ugly&mdash;as much a
sacrilege as if you had been trusted with the key
of the temple. This <em>is</em> the temple&mdash;don’t profane
it! Keep up the old altar kindly&mdash;you
can’t set up a new one as good. You <em>must</em> have
beauty in your life, don’t you see?&mdash;that’s the
only way to make sure of it for the lives of others.
Keep leaving it to <em>them</em>, to all the poor others,”
she went on with her bright irony, “and heaven
only knows what will become of it! Does it take
one of <em>us</em> to feel that?&mdash;to preach you the truth?
Then it’s good, Captain Yule, we come right over&mdash;just
to see, you know, what you may happen to
be about. We know,” she went on while her
sense of proportion seemed to play into her sense
of humour, “what we haven’t got, worse luck; so
that if you’ve happily got it you’ve got it also for
<em>us</em>. You’ve got it in trust, you see, and oh! we
have an eye on you. You’ve had it so for me, all
these dear days that I’ve been drinking it in, that,
to be grateful, I’ve wanted regularly to <em>do</em> something.”
With which, as if in the rich confidence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_319" title="319"> </a>
of having convinced him, she came so near as
almost to touch him. “Tell me now I shall have
done it&mdash;I shall have kept you at your post!”</p>

<p>If he moved, on this, immediately further, it
was with the oddest air of seeking rather to study
her remarks at his ease than to express an independence
of them. He kept, to this end, his
face averted&mdash;he was so completely now in
intelligent possession of her own. The sacrifice
in question carried him even to the door of the
court, where he once more stood so long engaged
that the persistent presentation of his back might
at last have suggested either a confession or a
request.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, meanwhile, a little spent with
her sincerity, seated herself again in the great
chair, and if she sought, visibly enough, to read
a meaning into his movement, she had as little
triumph for one possible view of it as she had
resentment for the other. The possibility that
he yielded left her after all as vague in respect
to a next step as the possibility that he merely
wished to get rid of her. The moments elapsed
without her abdicating; and indeed when he
finally turned round his expression was an equal
check to any power to feel she might have won.
“You have,” he queerly smiled at her, “a standpoint
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_320" title="320"> </a>
quite your own and a style of eloquence
that the few scraps of parliamentary training I’ve
picked up don’t seem at all to fit me to deal
with. Of course I don’t pretend, you know,
that I don’t <em>care</em> for Covering.”</p>

<p>That, at all events, she could be glad to hear,
if only perhaps for the tone in it that was so
almost comically ingenuous. But her relief was
reasonable and her exultation temperate. “You
haven’t even seen it yet.” She risked, however,
a laugh. “Aren’t you a bit afraid?”</p>

<p>He took a minute to reply, then replied&mdash;as
if to make it up&mdash;with a grand collapse.
“Yes; awfully. But if I am,” he hastened in
decency to add, “it isn’t only Covering that
makes me.”</p>

<p>This left his friend apparently at a loss.
“What else is it?”</p>

<p>“Everything. But it doesn’t in the least
matter,” he loosely pursued. “You may be
quite correct. When we talk of the house your
voice comes to me somehow as the wind in its
old chimneys.”</p>

<p>Her amusement distinctly revived. “I hope
you don’t mean I roar!”</p>

<p>He blushed again; there was no doubt he
was confused. “No&mdash;nor yet perhaps that you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_321" title="321"> </a>
whistle! I don’t believe the wind does either,
here. It only whispers,” he sought gracefully
to explain; “and it sighs<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“And I hope,” she broke in, “that it sometimes
laughs!”</p>

<p>The sound she gave only made him, as he
looked at her, more serious. “Whatever it
does, it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“All right?”&mdash;they were sufficiently together
again for her to lay her hand straight on his
arm. “Then you promise?”</p>

<p>“Promise what?”</p>

<p>He had turned as pale as if she hurt him,
and she took her hand away. “To meet Mr.
Prodmore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no; not yet!”&mdash;he quite recovered
himself. “I must wait&mdash;I must think.”</p>

<p>She looked disappointed, and there was a
momentary silence. “When have you to answer
him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he gives me time!” Clement Yule
spoke very much as he might have said, “Oh,
in two minutes!”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> wouldn’t give you time,” Mrs. Gracedew
cried with force&mdash;“I’d give you a shaking!
For God’s sake, at any rate”&mdash;and she really
tried to push him off&mdash;“go upstairs!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_322" title="322"> </a>“And literally <em>find</em> the dreadful man?” This
was so little his personal idea that, distinctly
dodging her pressure, he had already reached
the safe quarter.</p>

<p>But it befell that at the same moment she
saw Cora reappear on the upper landing&mdash;a
circumstance that promised her a still better
conclusion. “He’s coming down!”</p>

<p>Cora, in spite of this announcement, came
down boldly enough without him and made
directly for Mrs. Gracedew, to whom her eyes
had attached themselves with an undeviating
glare. Her plain purpose of treating this lady
as an isolated presence allowed their companion
perfect freedom to consider her arrival with
sharp alarm. His disconcerted stare seemed
for a moment to balance; it wandered, gave
a wild glance at the open door, then searched
the ascent of the staircase, in which, apparently,
it now found a coercion. “I’ll go up!” he
gasped; and he took three steps at a time.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_323" title="323"> </a>V</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> girl threw herself, in her flushed eagerness,
straight upon the wonderful lady. “I’ve come
back to you&mdash;I want to speak to you!” The
need had been a rapid growth, but it was clearly
immense. “May I confide in you?”</p>

<p>Her instant overflow left Mrs. Gracedew both astonished
and amused. “You too?” she laughed.
“Why it <em>is</em> good we come over!”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed!” Cora gratefully echoed. “You
were so very kind to me and seemed to think me
so curious.”</p>

<p>The mirth of her friend redoubled. “Well, I
loved you for it, and it was nothing moreover to
what you thought <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>Miss Prodmore found, for this, no denial&mdash;she
only presented her frank high colour. “I
loved <em>you</em>. But I’m the worst!” she generously
added. “And I’m solitary.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so am I!” Mrs. Gracedew declared with
gaiety, but with emphasis. “A <em>very</em> queer thing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_324" title="324"> </a>
always <em>is</em> solitary! But, since we have that link,
by all means confide.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was met here by tremendous news.”
Cora produced it with a purple glow. “He wants
me to marry him!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked amiably receptive, but as
if she failed as yet to follow. “‘He’ wants you?”</p>

<p>“Papa, of course. He has settled it!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was still vague. “Settled
what?”</p>

<p>“Why, the whole question. That I must take
him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew seemed to frown at her own
scattered wits. “But, my dear, take <em>whom</em>?”</p>

<p>The girl looked surprised at this lapse of her
powers. “Why, Captain Yule, who just went
up.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mrs. Gracedew with a full stare.
“Oh!” she repeated, looking straight away.</p>

<p>“I thought you would know,” Cora gently
explained.</p>

<p>Her friend’s eyes, with a kinder light now,
came back to her. “I didn’t know.” Mrs. Gracedew
looked, in truth, as if that had been sufficiently
odd, and seemed also to wonder at two or
three things more. It all, however, broke quickly
into a question. “Has Captain Yule asked you?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_325" title="325"> </a>“No, but he <em>will</em>”&mdash;Cora was clear as a bell.
“He’ll do it to keep the house. It’s mortgaged
to papa, and Captain Yule buys it back.”</p>

<p>Her friend had an illumination that was rapid
for the way it spread. “By marrying you?” she
quavered.</p>

<p>Cora, under further parental instruction, had
plainly mastered the subject. “By giving me his
name and his position. They’re awfully great,
and they’re the price, don’t you see?” she modestly
mentioned. “<em>My</em> price. Papa’s price.
Papa wants them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew had caught hold; yet there
were places where her grasp was weak, and she
had, strikingly, begun again to reflect. “But
his name and his position, great as they may be,
are his dreadful politics!”</p>

<p>Cora threw herself with energy into this advance.
“You <em>know</em> about his dreadful politics?
He’s to change them,” she recited, “to get <em>me</em>.
And if he gets me<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“He keeps the house?”&mdash;Mrs. Gracedew
snatched it up.</p>

<p>Cora continued to show her schooling. “I go
<em>with</em> it&mdash;he’s to have us both. But only,” she
admonishingly added, “if he changes. The
question is&mdash;<em>will</em> he change?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_326" title="326"> </a>Mrs. Gracedew appeared profoundly to entertain
it. “I see. <em>Will</em> he change?”</p>

<p>Cora’s consideration of it went even further.
“<em>Has</em> he changed?”</p>

<p>It went&mdash;and the effect was odd&mdash;a little
too far for her companion, in whom, just discernibly,
it had touched the spring of impatience.
“My dear child, how in the world
should <em>I</em> know?”</p>

<p>But Cora knew exactly how anyone would
know. “He hasn’t seemed to care enough for
the house. <em>Does</em> he care?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew moved away, passed over to
the fireplace, and stood a moment looking at
the old armorial fire-back she had praised to its
master&mdash;yet not, it must be added, as if she
particularly saw it. Then as she faced about:
“You had better ask him!”</p>

<p>They stood thus confronted, with the fine old
interval between them, and the girl’s air was
for a moment that of considering such a course.
“If he does care,” she said at last, “he’ll
propose.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, from where she stood in relation
to the stairs, saw at this point the subject
of their colloquy restored to view: Captain
Yule was just upon them&mdash;he had turned the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_327" title="327"> </a>
upper landing. The sight of him forced from
her in a flash an ejaculation that she tried, however,
to keep private&mdash;“He does care!” She
passed swiftly, before he reached them, back to
the girl and, in a quick whisper, but with full
conviction, let her have it: “He’ll propose!”</p>

<p>Her movement had made her friend aware,
and the young man, hurrying down, was now
in the hall. Cora, at his hurry, looked dismay&mdash;“Then
I fly!” With which, casting about
for a direction, she reached the door to the
court.</p>

<p>Captain Yule, however, at this result of his
return, expressed instant regret. “I drive Miss
Prodmore away!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, more quickly still, eased off
the situation. “It’s all right!” She had embraced
both parties with a smile, but it was
most liberal now for Cora. “Do you mind,
one moment?”&mdash;it conveyed, unmistakeably, a
full intelligence and a fine explanation. “I’ve
something to say to Captain Yule.”</p>

<p>Cora stood in the doorway, robust against the
garden-light, and looking from one to the other.
“Yes&mdash;but I’ve also something more to say to
<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean now?” the young man asked.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_328" title="328"> </a>It was the first time he had spoken to her,
and her hesitation might have signified a
maidenly flutter. “No&mdash;but before she goes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew took it amiably up. “Come
back, then; I’m not going.” And there was
both dismissal and encouragement in the way
that, as on the occasion of the girl’s former
retreat, she blew her a familiar kiss. Cora, still
with her face to them, waited just enough to
show that she took it without a response; then,
with a quick turn, dashed out, while Mrs. Gracedew
looked at their visitor in vague surprise.
“What’s the matter with her?”</p>

<p>She had turned away as soon as she spoke,
moving as far from him as she had moved a few
moments before from Cora. The silence that,
as he watched her, followed her question would
have been seen by a spectator to be a hard one
for either to break. “I don’t know what’s the
matter with her,” he said at last; “I’m afraid I
only know what’s the matter with <em>me</em>. It will
doubtless give you pleasure to learn,” he added,
“that I’ve closed with Mr. Prodmore.”</p>

<p>It was a speech that, strangely enough, seemed
but half to dissipate the hush. Mrs. Gracedew
reached the great chimney again; again she
stood there with her face averted; and when she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_329" title="329"> </a>
finally replied it was in other words than he
might have supposed himself naturally to inspire.
“I thought you said he gave you time.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you produced just now so deep an
effect on me that I thought best not to take
any.” He appeared to listen to a sound from
above, and, for a moment, under this impulse, his
eyes travelled about almost as if he were alone.
Then he completed, with deliberation, his statement.
“I came upon him right there, and I
burnt my ships.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew continued not to meet his face.
“You do what he requires?”</p>

<p>The young man was markedly, consciously
caught. “I do what he requires. I felt the
tremendous force of all you said to me.”</p>

<p>She turned round on him now, as if perhaps
with a slight sharpness, the face of responsibility&mdash;even,
it might be, of reproach. “So did I&mdash;or
I shouldn’t have said it!”</p>

<p>It was doubtless this element of justification in
her tone that drew from him a laugh a tiny trifle
dry. “You’re perhaps not aware that you wield an
influence of which it’s not too much to say<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>But he paused at the important point so long
that she took him up. “To say what?”</p>

<p>“Well, that it’s practically irresistible!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_330" title="330"> </a>It sounded a little as if it had not been what he
first meant; but it made her, none the less, still
graver and just faintly ironical. “You’ve given
me the most flattering proof of my influence that
I’ve ever enjoyed in my life!”</p>

<p>He fixed her very hard, now distinctly so
mystified that he could only wonder what different
recall of her previous attitude she would
have looked for. “This was inevitable, dear
madam, from the moment you had converted
me&mdash;and in about three minutes too!&mdash;into the
absolute echo of your raptures.”</p>

<p>Nothing was, indeed, more extraordinary than
her air of having suddenly forgotten them. “My
‘raptures’?”</p>

<p>He was amazed. “Why, about my home.”</p>

<p>He might look her through and through, but
she had no eyes for himself, though she had now
quitted the fireplace and finally recognised this
allusion. “Oh, yes&mdash;your home!” From where
had she come back to it? “It’s a nice tattered,
battered old thing.” This account of it was the
more shrunken that her observation, even as she
spoke, freshly went the rounds. “It has defects
of course”&mdash;with this renewed attention they
appeared suddenly to strike her. They had
popped out, conspicuous, and for a little it might
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_331" title="331"> </a>
have been a matter of conscience. However, her
conscience dropped. “But it’s no use mentioning
them now!”</p>

<p>They had half an hour earlier been vividly
present to himself, but to see her thus oddly
pulled up by them was to forget on the spot
the ground he had taken. “I’m particularly
sorry,” he returned with some spirit, “that you
didn’t mention them before!”</p>

<p>At this imputation of inconsequence, of a
levity not, after all, without its excuse, Mrs.
Gracedew was reduced, in keeping her resentment
down, to an effort not quite successfully
disguised. It was in a tone, nevertheless, all the
more mild in intention that she reminded him
of where he had equally failed. “If you had
really gone over the house, as I almost went on
my knees to you to do, you might have discovered
some of them yourself!”</p>

<p>“How can you say that,” the young man
asked with heat, “when I was precisely in the
very act of it? It was just <em>because</em> I was that
the first person I met above was Mr. Prodmore;
on which, feeling that I must come to it sooner
or later, I simply gave in to him on the spot&mdash;yielded
him, to have it well over, the whole
of his point.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_332" title="332"> </a>She listened to this account of the matter as
she might have gazed, from afar, at some queer
object that was scarce distinguishable. It left
her a moment in the deepest thought, but she
presently recovered her tone. “Let me then
congratulate you on at last knowing what you
want!”</p>

<p>But there were, after all, he instantly showed,
no such great reasons for that. “I only know
it so far as <em>you</em> know it! I struck while the
iron was hot&mdash;or at any rate while the hammer
was.”</p>

<p>“Of course I recognise”&mdash;she adopted his
image with her restored gaiety&mdash;“that it can
rarely have been exposed to such a fire. I
blazed up, and I know that when I burn<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>She had pulled up with the foolish sense of
this. “When you burn?”</p>

<p>“Well, I do it as Chicago does.”</p>

<p>He also could laugh out now. “Isn’t that
usually down to the ground?”</p>

<p>Meeting his laugh, she threw up her light
arms. “As high as the sky!” Then she came
back, as with a scruple, to the real question.
“I suppose you’ve still formalities to go
through.”</p>

<p>“With Mr. Prodmore?” Well, he would suppose
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_333" title="333"> </a>
it too if she liked. “Oh, endless, tiresome
ones, no doubt!”</p>

<p>This sketch of them made her wonder. “You
mean they’ll take so very, very long?”</p>

<p>He seemed after all to know perfectly what
he meant. “Every hour, every month, that I
can possibly make them last!”</p>

<p>She was with him here, however, but to a certain
point. “You mustn’t drag them out <em>too</em>
much&mdash;must you? Won’t he think in that
case you may want to retract?”</p>

<p>Yule apparently tried to focus Mr. Prodmore
under this delusion, and with a success that had
a quick, odd result. “I shouldn’t be so terribly
upset by his mistake, you know, even if he did!”</p>

<p>His manner, with its slight bravado, left her
proportionately shocked. “Oh, it would never
do to give him any colour whatever for supposing
you to have any doubt that, as one may say,
you’ve pledged your honour.”</p>

<p>He devoted to this proposition more thought
than its simplicity would have seemed to demand;
but after a minute, at all events, his
intelligence triumphed. “Of course not&mdash;not
when I <em>haven’t</em> any doubt!”</p>

<p>Though his intelligence had triumphed, she
still wished to show she was there to support it.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_334" title="334"> </a>
“How can you <em>possibly</em> have any&mdash;any more
than you can possibly have that one’s honour is
everything in life?” And her charming eyes
expressed to him her need to feel that he was
quite at one with her on <em>that</em> point.</p>

<p>He could give her every assurance. “Oh, yes&mdash;everything
in life!”</p>

<p>It did her much good, brought back the rest
of her brightness. “Wasn’t it just of the question
of the honour of things that we talked
awhile ago&mdash;and of the difficulty of sometimes
keeping our sense of it clear? There’s no more
to be said therefore,” she went on with the faintest
soft sigh about it, “except that I leave you
to your ancient glory as I leave you to your
strict duty.” She had these things there before
her; they might have been a well-spread board
from which she turned away fasting. “I hope
you’ll do justice to dear old Covering in spite
of its weak points, and I hope above all you’ll
not be incommoded<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>As she hesitated here he was too intent. “Incommoded<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>She saw it better than she could express it.
“Well, by such a rage<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>He challenged this description with a strange
gleam. “You suppose it will be a rage?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_335" title="335"> </a>She laughed out at his look. “Are you afraid
of the love that kills?”</p>

<p>He grew singularly grave. “<em>Will</em> it kill<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Great passions <em>have</em>!”&mdash;she was highly
amused.</p>

<p>But he could only stare. “Is it a great passion?”</p>

<p>“Surely&mdash;when so many feel it!”</p>

<p>He was fairly bewildered. “But how many<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>She reckoned them up. “Let’s see. If you
count them all<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“‘All’?” Clement Yule gasped.</p>

<p>She looked at him, in turn, slightly mystified.
“I see. You knock off some. About half?”</p>

<p>It was too obscure&mdash;he broke down. “Whom
on earth are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Why, the electors<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Of Gossage?”&mdash;he leaped at it. “Oh!”</p>

<p>“I got the whole thing up&mdash;there are six
thousand. It’s such a fine figure!” said Mrs.
Gracedew.</p>

<p>He had sharply passed from her, to cover his
mistake, and it carried him half round the hall.
Then, as if aware that this pause itself compromised
him, he came back confusedly and with her
last words in his ear. “<em>Has</em> she a fine figure?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_336" title="336"> </a>But her own thoughts were off. “‘She’?”</p>

<p>He blushed and recovered himself. “Aren’t
we talking<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Of Gossage? Oh, yes&mdash;she has every charm!
Good-bye,” said Mrs. Gracedew.</p>

<p>He pulled, at this, the longest face, but was
kept dumb a moment by the very decision with
which she again began to gather herself. It
held him helpless, and there was finally real
despair in his retarded protest. “You don’t
mean to say you’re going?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’re surprised at
it? Haven’t I done,” she luminously asked,
“what I told you I had been so mystically moved
to come for?” She recalled to him by her renewed
supreme survey the limited character of
this errand, which she then in a brisk familiar
word expressed to the house itself. “You dear
old thing&mdash;you’re saved!”</p>

<p>Clement Yule might on the other hand, by his
simultaneous action, have given himself out for
lost. “For God’s sake,” he cried as he circled
earnestly round her, “don’t go till I can come
back to thank you!” He pulled out his watch.
“I promised to return immediately to Prodmore.”</p>

<p>This completely settled his visitor. “Then
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_337" title="337"> </a>
don’t let me, for a moment more, keep you away
from him. You must have such lots”&mdash;it went
almost without saying&mdash;“to talk comfortably
over.”</p>

<p>The young man’s embrace of that was, in his
restless movement, to roam to the end of the
hall furthest from the stairs. But here his assent
was entire. “I certainly feel, you know,
that I must see him again.” He rambled even
to the open door and looked with incoherence
into the court. “Yes, decidedly, I <em>must</em>!”</p>

<p>“Is he out there?” Mrs. Gracedew lightly
asked.</p>

<p>He turned short round. “No&mdash;I left him
in the long gallery.”</p>

<p>“You <em>saw</em> that, then?”&mdash;she flashed back into
eagerness. “Isn’t it lovely?”</p>

<p>Clement Yule rather wondered. “I didn’t
notice it. How <em>could</em> I?”</p>

<p>His face was so woeful that she broke into a
laugh. “How <em>couldn’t</em> you? Notice it now,
then. Go up to him!”</p>

<p>He crossed at last to the staircase, but at the
foot he stopped again. “Will you wait for
me?”</p>

<p>He had such an air of proposing a bargain,
of making the wait a condition, that she had to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_338" title="338"> </a>
look it well in the face. The result of her doing
so, however, was apparently a strong sense that
she could give him no pledge. Her silence, after
a moment, expressed that; but, for a further
emphasis, moving away, she sank suddenly into
the chair she had already occupied and in
which, serious again and very upright, she continued
to withhold her promise. “Go up to
him!” she simply repeated. He obeyed, with
an abrupt turn, mounting briskly enough several
steps, but pausing midway and looking back
at her as if he were after all irresolute. He was
in fact so much so that, at the sight of her still
in her chair and alone by his cold hearth, he
descended a few steps again and seemed, with
too much decidedly on his mind, on the point
of breaking out. She had sat a minute in such
thought, figuring him clearly as gone, that at
the sound of his return she sprang up with a
protest. This checked him afresh, and he remained
where he had paused, still on the ascent
and exchanging with her a look to which neither
party was inspired, oddly enough, to contribute
a word. It struck him, without words, at all
events, as enough, and he now took his upward
course at such a pace that he presently disappeared.
She listened awhile to his retreating
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_339" title="339"> </a>
tread; then her own, on the old flags of the hall,
became rapid, though, it may perhaps be added,
directed to no visible end. It conveyed her, in
the great space, from point to point, but she now
for the first time moved there without attention
and without joy, her course determined by a series
of such inward throbs as might have been the
suppressed beats of a speech. A real observer, had
such a monster been present, would have followed
this tacit evolution from sign to sign and from
shade to shade. “Why didn’t he tell me <em>all</em>?&mdash;But
it was none of my business!&mdash;What does
he mean to do?&mdash;What should he do but what
he <em>has</em> done?&mdash;And what <em>can</em> he do, when he’s
so deeply committed, when he’s practically engaged,
when he’s just the same as married&mdash;and
buried?&mdash;The thing for <em>me</em> to ‘do’ is just
to pull up short and bundle out: to remove
from the scene they encumber the numerous
fragments&mdash;well, of what?”</p>

<p>Her thought was plainly arrested by the sight
of Cora Prodmore, who, returning from the garden,
reappeared first in the court and then in
the open doorway. Mrs. Gracedew’s was a
thought, however, that, even when desperate,
was never quite vanquished, and it found a presentable
public solution in the pieces of the vase
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_340" title="340"> </a>
smashed by Chivers and just then, on the table
where he had laid them, catching her eye. “Of
my old Chelsea pot!” Her gay, sad headshake
as she took one of them up pronounced for
Cora’s benefit its funeral oration. She laid the
morsel thoughtfully down, while her visitor
seemed with simple dismay to read the story.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_341" title="341"> </a>VI</h3>

<p>“<span class="small-caps">Has</span> he been <em>breaking</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?” the girl asked
in horror.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew laughingly tapped her heart.
“Yes, we’ve had a scene! He went up again
to your father.”</p>

<p>Cora was disconcerted. “Papa’s not there.
He just came down to me by the other way.”</p>

<p>“Then he can join you here,” said Mrs. Gracedew
with instant resignation. “I’m going.”</p>

<p>“Just when I’ve come back to you&mdash;at the
risk,” Cora made bold to throw off, “of again
interrupting, though I really hoped he had gone,
your conversation with Captain Yule?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gracedew let the ball quite drop.
“I’ve nothing to say to Captain Yule.”</p>

<p>Cora picked it up for another toss. “You
had a good deal to say a few minutes ago!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve said it, and it’s over. I’ve nothing
more to say at all,” Mrs. Gracedew insisted.
But her announcement of departure left her on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_342" title="342"> </a>
this occasion, as each of its predecessors had
done, with a last, with indeed a fresh, solicitude.
“What has become of my delightful ‘party’?”</p>

<p>“They’ve been dismissed, through the grounds,
by the other door. But they mentioned,” the girl
pursued, “the probable arrival of a fresh lot.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew showed on this such a revival
of interest as fairly amounted to yearning.
“Why, what times you have! <em>You</em>,” she nevertheless
promptly decreed, “must take the fresh
lot&mdash;since the house is now practically yours!”</p>

<p>Poor Cora looked blank. “Mine?”</p>

<p>Her companion matched her stare. “Why,
if you’re going to marry Captain Yule.”</p>

<p>Cora coloured, in a flash, to the eyes. “I’m
<em>not</em> going to marry Captain Yule!”</p>

<p>Her friend as quickly paled again. “Why on
earth then did you tell me only ten minutes
ago that you were?”</p>

<p>Cora could only look bewildered at the charge.
“I told you nothing of the sort. I only told
you”&mdash;she was almost indignantly positive&mdash;“that
he had been ordered me!”</p>

<p>It sent Mrs. Gracedew off; she moved away
to indulge an emotion that presently put on the
form of extravagant mirth. “Like a dose of
medicine or a course of baths?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_343" title="343"> </a>The girl’s gravity and lucidity sustained themselves.
“As a remedy for the single life.” Oh,
she had mastered the matter now! “But I
won’t take him!”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, why didn’t you let me know?”
Mrs. Gracedew panted.</p>

<p>“I was on the very point of it when he came
in and interrupted us.” Cora clearly felt she
might be wicked, but was at least not stupid.
“It’s just to let you know that I’m here now.”</p>

<p>Ah, the difference it made! This difference,
for Mrs. Gracedew, suddenly shimmered in all
the place, and her companion’s fixed eyes caught
in her face the reflection of it. “Excuse me&mdash;I
misunderstood. I somehow took for granted<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”
She stopped, a trifle awkwardly&mdash;suddenly
tender, for Cora, as to the way she had
inevitably seen it.</p>

<p>“You took for granted I’d jump at him?
Well, you can take it for granted I won’t!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, fairly admiring her, put it
sympathetically. “You prefer the single life?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;but I don’t prefer <em>him</em>!” Cora was
crystal-bright.</p>

<p>Her light, indeed, for her friend, was at first
almost blinding; it took Mrs. Gracedew a
moment to distinguish&mdash;which she then did,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_344" title="344"> </a>
however, with immense eagerness. “You prefer
someone else?” Cora’s promptitude dropped at
this, and, starting to hear it, as you might well
have seen, for the first time publicly phrased, she
abruptly moved away. A minute’s sense of her
scruple was enough for Mrs. Gracedew: this was
proved by the tone of soft remonstrance and high
benevolence with which that lady went on. She
had looked very hard, first, at one of the old warriors
hung on the old wall, and almost spoke as if
he represented their host. “He seems remarkably
clever.”</p>

<p>Cora, at something in the sound, quite jumped
about. “Then why don’t you marry him yourself?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew gave a sort of happy sigh.
“Well, I’ve got fifty reasons! I rather think
one of them must be that he hasn’t happened to
ask me.”</p>

<p>It was a speech, however, that her visitor
could easily better. “I haven’t got fifty reasons,
but I <em>have</em> got one.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew smiled as if it were indeed a
stroke of wit. “You mean your case is one of
those in which safety is <em>not</em> in numbers?” And
then on Cora’s visibly not understanding: “It <em>is</em>
when reasons are bad that one needs so many!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_345" title="345"> </a>The proposition was too general for the girl to
embrace, but the simplicity of her answer was
far from spoiling it. “My reason is awfully
good.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew did it complete justice. “I
see. An older friend.”</p>

<p>Cora listened as at a warning sound; yet she
had by this time practically let herself go, and it
took but Mrs. Gracedew’s extended encouraging
hand, which she quickly seized, to bring the
whole thing out. “I’ve been trying this hour,
in my terrible need of advice, to tell you about
him!” It came in a small clear torrent, a soft
tumble-out of sincerity. “After we parted&mdash;you
and I&mdash;at the station, he suddenly turned
up there, and I took a little quiet walk with him
which gave you time to get here before me and
of which my father is in a state of ignorance
that I don’t know whether to regard as desirable
or dreadful.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, attentive and wise, might have
been, for her face, the old family solicitor. “You
want me then to <em>inform</em> your father?” It was
a wonderful intonation.</p>

<p>Poor Cora, for that matter too, might suddenly
have become under this touch the prodigal with
a list of debts. She seemed an instant to look out
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_346" title="346"> </a>
of a blurred office window-pane at a grey London
sky; then she broke away. “I really don’t
know <em>what</em> I want. I think,” she honestly admitted,
“I just want kindness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew’s expression might have hinted&mdash;but
not for too long&mdash;that Bedford Row was
an odd place to apply for it; she appeared for
an instant to make the revolving office-chair
creak. “What do you mean by kindness?”</p>

<p>Cora was a model client&mdash;she perfectly knew.
“I mean help.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew closed an inkstand with a clap
and locked a couple of drawers. “What do
you mean by help?”</p>

<p>The client’s inevitable answer seemed to perch
on the girl’s lips: “A thousand pounds.” But
it came out in another, in a much more charming
form. “I mean that I love him.”</p>

<p>The family solicitor got up: it was a high
figure. “And does he love <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>Cora hesitated. “Ask <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew weighed the necessity.
“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Waiting.” And the girl’s glance, removed
from her companion and wandering aloft and
through space, gave the scale of his patience.</p>

<p>Her adviser, however, required the detail.
“But <em>where</em>?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_347" title="347"> </a>Cora briefly demurred again. “In that
funny old grotto.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew thought. “Funny?”</p>

<p>“Half-way from the park gate. It’s very
<em>nice</em>!” Cora more eagerly added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew continued to reflect. “Oh, I
know it!” She spoke as if she had known it
most of her life.</p>

<p>Her tone encouraged her client. “Then will
you see him?”</p>

<p>“No.” This time it was almost dry.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No. If you want help<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” Mrs. Gracedew,
still musing, explained.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you want a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so much!”&mdash;Cora but too woefully took
it in. “I want,” she quavered, “all there
is!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;you shall have it.”</p>

<p>“All there is?”&mdash;she convulsively held her
to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew had finally mastered it. “I’ll
see your father.”</p>

<p>“You dear, delicious lady!” Her young
friend had again encompassed her; but, passive
and preoccupied, she showed some of the chill
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_348" title="348"> </a>
of apprehension. It was indeed as if to meet
this that Cora went earnestly on: “He’s intensely
sympathetic!”</p>

<p>“Your father?” Mrs. Gracedew had her
reserves.</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;the other person. I so believe in
him!” Cora cried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked at her a moment. “Then
so do I&mdash;and I like him for believing in <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he does that,” the girl hurried on, “far
more than Captain Yule&mdash;I could see just with
one glance that <em>he</em> doesn’t at all. Papa has of
course seen the young man I mean, but we’ve
been so sure papa would hate it that we’ve had
to be awfully careful. He’s the son of the
richest man at Bellborough, he’s Granny’s godson,
and he’ll inherit his father’s business, which
is simply immense. Oh, from the point of view
of the things he’s <em>in</em>”&mdash;and Cora found herself
sharp on this&mdash;“he’s quite as good as papa
himself. He has been away for three days, and
if he met me at the station, where, on his way
back, he has to change, it was by the merest
chance in the world. I wouldn’t love him,” she
brilliantly wound up, “if he wasn’t nice.”</p>

<p>“A man’s always nice if you <em>will</em> love him!”
Mrs. Gracedew laughed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_349" title="349"> </a>Her young friend more than met it. “He’s
nicer still if he ‘will’ love <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gracedew kept her head. “Nicer of
course than if he won’t! But are you sure this
gentleman <em>does</em> love you?”</p>

<p>“As sure as that the other one doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but the other one doesn’t know you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank goodness&mdash;and never shall!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew watched her a little, but on the
girl’s meeting her eyes turned away with a quick
laugh. “You mean of course till it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Altogether!” Cora spoke as with quite the
measure of the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, revolving a moment in silence,
appeared to accept her showing. “Then what’s
the matter?” she impatiently asked.</p>

<p>“The matter?”</p>

<p>“Your father’s objection to the gentleman in
the grotto.”</p>

<p>Cora now for the first time faltered. “His
name.”</p>

<p>This for a moment pulled up her friend, in
whom, however, relief seemed to contend with
alarm. “Only his name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” Cora’s eyes rolled.</p>

<p>Her companion invitingly laughed. “But it’s
enough?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_350" title="350"> </a>Her roll confessingly fixed itself. “<em>Not</em> enough&mdash;that’s
just the trouble!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked kindly curious. “What
then <em>is</em> it?”</p>

<p>Cora faced the music. “Pegg.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew stared. “Nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of.” The girl was quite
candid now. “Hall.”</p>

<p>“Nothing before<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Not a letter.”</p>

<p>“Hall Pegg?” Mrs. Gracedew had winced,
but she quickly recovered herself, and, for a
further articulation, appeared, from delicacy, to
form the sound only with her mind. The sound
she formed with her lips was, after an instant,
simply “Oh!”</p>

<p>It was to the combination of the spoken and
the unspoken that Cora desperately replied. “It
sounds like a hat-rack!”</p>

<p>“‘Hall Pegg’? ‘Hall Pegg’?” Mrs. Gracedew
now made it, like a questionable coin, ring upon
the counter. But it lay there as lead and without,
for a moment, her taking it up again. “How
many has your father?” she inquired instead.</p>

<p>“How many names?” Miss Prodmore seemed
dimly to see that there was no hope in that. “He
somehow makes out five.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_351" title="351"> </a>“Oh, that’s <em>too</em> many!” Mrs. Gracedew jeeringly
declared.</p>

<p>“Papa unfortunately doesn’t think so, when
Captain Yule, I believe, has six.”</p>

<p>“Six?” Mrs. Gracedew, alert, looked as if
that might be different.</p>

<p>“Papa, in the morning-room, told me them all.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew visibly considered, then for a moment
dropped Mr. Pegg. “And what <em>are</em> they!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all sorts. ‘Marmaduke Clement<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>’”
Cora tried to recall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, however, had already checked
her. “I see&mdash;‘Marmaduke Clement’ will do.”
She appeared for a minute intent, but, as with an
energetic stoop, she picked up Mr. Pegg. “But
so will yours,” she said, with decision.</p>

<p>“Mine?&mdash;you mean <em>his</em>!”</p>

<p>“The same thing&mdash;what you’ll <em>be</em>.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hall Pegg!”&mdash;Cora tried it, with resolution,
loudly.</p>

<p>It fell a little flat in the noble space, but Mrs.
Gracedew’s manner quickly covered it. “It
won’t make you a bit less charming.”</p>

<p>Cora wondered&mdash;she hoped. “Only for papa.”</p>

<p>And what was <em>he</em>? Mrs. Gracedew by this
time seemed assentingly to ask. “Never for
<em>me</em>!” she soothingly declared.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_352" title="352"> </a>Cora took this in with deep thanks that gripped
and patted her companion’s hand. “You accept
it more than gracefully. But if you could only
make <em>him</em><span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was all concentration. “‘Him’?
Mr. Pegg?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;he naturally <em>has</em> to accept it. But
papa.”</p>

<p>She looked harder still at this greater feat, then
seemed to see light. “Well, it will be difficult&mdash;but
I will.”</p>

<p>Doubt paled before it. “Oh, you heavenly
thing!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew after an instant, sustained by
this appreciation, went a step further. “And I’ll
make him <em>say</em> he does!”</p>

<p>Cora closed her eyes with the dream of it.
“Oh, if I could only hear him!”</p>

<p>Her benefactress had at last run it to earth.
“It will be enough if <em>I</em> do.”</p>

<p>Cora quickly considered; then, with prompt
accommodation, gave the comfortable measure of
her faith. “Yes&mdash;I think it will.” She was
quite ready to retire. “I’ll give you time.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Gracedew; “but
before you give me time give me something
better.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_353" title="353"> </a>This pulled the girl up a little, as if in parting
with her secret she had parted with her all.
“Something better?”</p>

<p>“If I help you, you know,” Mrs. Gracedew
explained, “you must help me.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“By a clear assurance.” The charming woman’s
fine face now gave the real example of clearness.
“That if Captain Yule should propose to you, you
would unconditionally refuse him.”</p>

<p>Cora flushed with the surprise of its being only
that. “With my dying breath!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew scanned her robust vitality.
“Will you make it even a promise?”</p>

<p>The girl looked about her in solid certainty.
“Do you want me to sign<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was quick. “No, don’t sign!”</p>

<p>Yet Cora was so ready to oblige. “Then what
shall I do?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew turned away, but after a few
vague steps faced her again. “Kiss me.”</p>

<p>Cora flew to her arms, and the compact had
scarce been sealed before the younger of the parties
was already at the passage to the front. “We
meet of course at the station.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew thought. “If all goes well.
But where shall you be meanwhile?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_354" title="354"> </a>Her confederate had no need to think. “Can’t
you guess?”</p>

<p>The bang of the house-door, the next minute,
so helped the answer to the riddle as fairly to
force it, when she found herself alone, from her
lips. “At that funny old grotto? Well,” she
sighed, “I <em>like</em> funny old grottos!” She found
herself alone, however, only for a minute; Mr.
Prodmore’s formidable presence had darkened the
door from the court.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_355" title="355"> </a>VII</h3>

<p>“<span class="small-caps">My</span> daughter’s not here?” he demanded from
the threshold.</p>

<p>“Your daughter’s not here.” She had rapidly
got under arms. “But it’s a convenience to me,
Mr. Prodmore, that <em>you</em> are, for I’ve something
very particular to ask you.”</p>

<p>Her interlocutor crossed straight to the morning-room.
“I shall be delighted to answer your
question, but I must first put my hand on Miss
Prodmore.” This hand the next instant stayed
itself on the latch, and he appealed to the amiable
visitor. “Unless indeed she’s occupied in there
with Captain Yule?”</p>

<p>The amiable visitor met the appeal. “I don’t
think she’s occupied&mdash;anywhere&mdash;with Captain
Yule.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore came straight away from the
door. “Then where the deuce <em>is</em> Captain Yule?”</p>

<p>The amiable visitor turned a trifle less direct.
“His absence, for which I’m responsible, is just
what renders the inquiry I speak of to you possible.”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_356" title="356"> </a>
She had already assumed a most inquiring
air, yet it was soon clear that she needed every
advantage her manner could give her. “What
will you take<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>? what will you take<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>It had the sound, as she faltered, of a general
question, and Mr. Prodmore raised his eyebrows.
“Take? Nothing, thank you&mdash;I’ve just had a
cup of tea.” Then suddenly, as if on the broad
hint: “Won’t <em>you</em> have one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with pleasure&mdash;but not yet.” She
looked about her again; she was now at close
quarters and, concentrated, anxious, pressed her
hand a moment to her brow.</p>

<p>This struck her companion. “Don’t you
think you’d be better for it immediately?”</p>

<p>“No.” She was positive. “No.” Her eyes
consciously wandered. “I want to know how
you’d value<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He took her, as his own followed them, more
quickly up, expanding in the presence of such
a tribute from a real connoisseur. “One of these
charming old things that take your fancy?”</p>

<p>She looked at him straight now. “They <em>all</em>
take my fancy!”</p>

<p>“All?” He enjoyed it as the joke of a rich
person&mdash;the kind of joke he sometimes made
himself.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_357" title="357"> </a>“Every single one!” said Mrs. Gracedew.
Then with still a finer shade of the familiar:
“Should you be willing to treat, Mr. Prodmore,
for your interest in this property?”</p>

<p>He threw back his head: she had scattered
over the word “interest” such a friendly, faded
colour. She was either <em>not</em> joking or was rich
indeed; and there was a place always kept in
his conversation for the arrival of money, as
there is always a box in a well-appointed theatre
for that of royalty. “Am I to take it from you
then that you <em>know</em> about my interest<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Everything!” said Mrs. Gracedew with a
world of wit.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, madam!”&mdash;he himself was now
more reserved. “You don’t know everything
if you don’t know that my interest&mdash;considerable
as it might well have struck you&mdash;has just
ceased to exist. I’ve given it up”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore
softened the blow&mdash;“for a handsome
equivalent.”</p>

<p>The blow fell indeed light enough. “You
mean for a handsome son-in-law?”</p>

<p>“It will be by some such description as the
term you use that I shall doubtless, in the
future, permit myself, in the common course, to
allude to Captain Yule. Unless indeed I call him<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_358" title="358"> </a>
But Mr. Prodmore dropped the bolder
thought. “It will depend on what he calls <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew covered him a moment with
the largeness of her charity. “Won’t it depend
a little on what your daughter herself calls him?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore seriously considered. “No.
That,” he declared with delicacy, “will be between
the happy pair.”</p>

<p>“Am I to take it from you then&mdash;I adopt
your excellent phrase,” Mrs. Gracedew said&mdash;“that
Miss Prodmore has already accepted him?”</p>

<p>Her companion, with his head still in the air,
seemed to signify that he simply put it down
on the table and that she could take it or not
as she liked. “Her character&mdash;formed by my
assiduous care&mdash;enables me to locate her, I may
say even to <em>time</em> her, from moment to moment.”
His massive watch, as he opened it, further
sustained him in this process. “It’s my assured
conviction that she’s accepting him while
we stand here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was so affected by his assured
conviction that, with an odd, inarticulate sound,
she forbore to stand longer&mdash;she rapidly moved
away, taking one of the brief excursions of step
and sense that had been for her, from the first,
under the noble roof, so many dumb but decisive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_359" title="359"> </a>
communions. But it was soon over, and she
floated back on a wave that showed her to be,
since she had let herself go, by this time quite
in the swing and describing a considerable curve.
“Dear Mr. Prodmore, why are you so imprudent
as to make your daughter afraid of you?
You should have taught her to confide in you.
She has clearly shown me,” she almost soothingly
pursued, “that she <em>can</em> confide.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, however, suddenly starting,
looked far from soothed. “She confides in
<em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“You may take it from me!” Mrs. Gracedew
laughed. “Let me suggest that, as fortune
has thrown us together a minute, you follow
her good example.” She put out a reassuring
hand&mdash;she could perfectly show him the way.
“Tell me, for instance, the ground of your
objection to poor Mr. Pegg. I mean Mr. Pegg
of Bellborough, Mr. Hall Pegg, the godson of
your daughter’s grandmother and the associate
of his father in their flourishing house; to
whom (as <em>he</em> is to <em>it</em> and to <em>her</em>) Miss Prodmore’s
devotedly attached.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore had in the course of this speech
availed himself of the support of the nearest
chair, where, in spite of his subsidence, he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_360" title="360"> </a>
appeared in his amazement twice his natural size.
“It has gone so far as <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>She rose before him as if in triumph. “It
has gone so far that you had better let it go
the rest of the way!”</p>

<p>He had lost breath, but he had positively
gained dignity. “It’s too monstrous, to have
plotted to keep me in the dark!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only when you’re kept in the
dark that your daughter’s kept in the light!”
She argued it with a candour that might have
served for brilliancy. “It’s at her own earnest
request that I plead to you for her liberty of
choice. She’s an honest girl&mdash;perhaps even a
peculiar girl; and she’s not a baby. You over-do,
I think, the nursing. She has a perfect right
to her preference.”</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Prodmore couldn’t help taking it
from her, and, this being the case, he still took
it in the most convenient way. “And pray
haven’t I a perfect right to mine?” he asked
from his chair.</p>

<p>She fairly seemed to serve it up to him&mdash;to
put down the dish with a flourish. “Not at
her expense. You expect her to give up too
much.”</p>

<p>“And what has she,” he appealed, “expected
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_361" title="361"> </a>
<em>me</em> to give up? What but the desire of my
heart and the dream of my life? Captain Yule
announced to me but a few minutes since his
intention to offer her his hand.”</p>

<p>She faced him on it as over the table. “Well,
if he does, I think he’ll simply find<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Find what?” They looked at each other
hard.</p>

<p>“Why, that she won’t have it.”</p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Prodmore now sprang up. “She
<em>will</em>!”</p>

<p>“She won’t!” Mrs. Gracedew more distinctly
repeated.</p>

<p>“She <em>shall</em>!” returned her adversary, making
for the staircase with the evident sense of where
reinforcement might be most required.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew, however, with a spring, was
well before him. “She shan’t!” She spoke
with positive passion and practically so barred
the way that he stood arrested and bewildered,
and they faced each other, for a flash, like
enemies. But it all went out, on her part, in a
flash too&mdash;in a sudden wonderful smile. “Now
tell me how much!”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore continued to glare&mdash;the sweat
was on his brow. But while he slowly wiped it
with a pocket-handkerchief of splendid scarlet
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_362" title="362"> </a>
silk, he remained so silent that he would have
had for a spectator the effect of meeting in a
manner her question. More formally to answer
it he had at last to turn away. “How can I tell
you anything so preposterous?”</p>

<p>She was all ready to inform him. “Simply
by computing the total amount to which, for your
benefit, this unhappy estate is burdened.” He
listened with his back presented, but that appeared
to strike her, as she fixed this expanse,
as an encouragement to proceed. “If I’ve
troubled you by showing you that your speculation
is built on the sand, let me atone for it by
my eagerness to take off your hands an investment
from which you derive so little profit.”</p>

<p>He at last gave her his attention, but quite as
if there were nothing in it. “And pray what
profit will <em>you</em> derive<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s my own secret!” She would show
him as well no glimpse of it&mdash;her laugh but
rattled the box. “I want this house!”</p>

<p>“So do I, damn me!” he roundly returned;
“and that’s why I’ve practically paid for it!”
He stuffed away his pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>There was nevertheless something in her that
could hold him, and it came out, after an instant,
quietly and reasonably enough. “I’ll practically
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_363" title="363"> </a>
pay for it, Mr. Prodmore&mdash;if you’ll only tell me
your figure.”</p>

<p>“My figure?”</p>

<p>“Your figure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore waited&mdash;then removed his eyes
from her face. He appeared to have waited on
purpose to let her hope of a soft answer fall from
a greater height. “My figure would be quite my
own!”</p>

<p>“Then it will match, in that respect,” Mrs.
Gracedew laughed, “this overture, which is quite
<em>my</em> own! As soon as you’ve let me know it I
cable to Missoura Top to have the money sent
right out to you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore surveyed in a superior manner
this artless picture of a stroke of business. “You
imagine that having the money sent right out to
me will make you owner of this place?”</p>

<p>She herself, with her head on one side, studied
her sketch and seemed to twirl her pencil. “No&mdash;not
quite. But I’ll settle the rest with Captain
Yule.”</p>

<p>Her companion looked, over his white waistcoat,
at his large tense shoes, the patent-leather
shine of which so flashed propriety back at him
that he became, the next moment, doubly erect on
it. “Captain Yule has nothing to sell.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_364" title="364"> </a>She received the remark with surprise. “Then
what have you been trying to buy?”</p>

<p>She had touched in himself even a sharper
spring. “Do you mean to say,” he cried, “you
want to buy <em>that</em>?” She stared at his queer
emphasis, which was intensified by a queer grimace;
then she turned from him with a change
of colour and an ejaculation that led to nothing
more, after a few seconds, than a somewhat
conscious silence&mdash;a silence of which Mr. Prodmore
made use to follow up his unanswered
question with another. “Is your proposal that
I should transfer my investment to you for the
mere net amount of it your conception of a fair
bargain?”</p>

<p>This second inquiry, however, she could, as
she slowly came round, substantially meet.
“Pray, then, what is yours?”</p>

<p>“Mine would be, not that I should simply
get my money back, but that I should get the
effective value of the house.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew considered it. “But isn’t
the effective value of the house just what your
money expresses?”</p>

<p>The lid of his hard left eye, the harder of the
two, just dipped with the effect of a wink. “No,
madam. It’s just what <em>yours</em> does. It’s moreover
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_365" title="365"> </a>
just what your lips have already expressed
so distinctly!”</p>

<p>She clearly did her best to follow him. “To
those people&mdash;when I showed the place off?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore laughed. “You seemed to be
<em>taking</em> bids then!”</p>

<p>She was candid, but earnest. “Taking
them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, like an auctioneer! You ran it up high!”
And Mr. Prodmore laughed again.</p>

<p>She turned a little pale, but it added to her
brightness. “I certainly did, if saying it was
charming<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Charming?” Mr. Prodmore broke in. “You
said it was magnificent. You said it was unique.
That was your very word. You said it was the
<em>perfect</em> specimen of its class in England.” He
was more than accusatory, he was really crushing.
“Oh, you got in deep!”</p>

<p>It was indeed an indictment, and her smile
was perhaps now rather set. “Possibly. But
taunting me with my absurd high spirits and
the dreadful liberties I took doesn’t in the least
tell me how deep <em>you’re</em> in!”</p>

<p>“For you, Mrs. Gracedew?” He took a few
steps, looking at his shoes again and as if to give
her time to plead&mdash;since he wished to be quite
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_366" title="366"> </a>
fair&mdash;that it was <em>not</em> for her. “I’m in to the
tune of fifty thousand.”</p>

<p>She was silent, on this announcement, so long
that he once more faced her; but if what he
showed her in doing so at last made her speak,
it also took the life from her tone. “That’s a
great deal of money, Mr. Prodmore.”</p>

<p>The tone didn’t matter, but only the truth it
expressed, which he so thoroughly liked to hear.
“So I’ve often had occasion to say to myself!”</p>

<p>“If it’s a large sum for you, then,” said Mrs.
Gracedew, “it’s a still larger one for me.” She
sank into a chair with a vague melancholy;
such a mass loomed huge, and she sat down
before it as a solitary herald, resigning himself
with a sigh to wait, might have leaned against
a tree before a besieged city. “We women”&mdash;she
wished to conciliate&mdash;“have more modest
ideas.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Prodmore would scarce condescend
to parley. “Is it as a ‘modest idea’ that you
describe your extraordinary intrusion<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>His question scarce reached her; she was so
lost for the moment in the sense of innocent
community with her sex. “I mean I think we
measure things often rather more exactly.”</p>

<p>There would have been no doubt of Mr. Prodmore’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_367" title="367"> </a>
very different community as he rudely
replied: “Then you measured <em>this</em> thing exactly
half an hour ago!”</p>

<p>It was a long way to go back, but Mrs. Gracedew,
in her seat, musingly made the journey,
from which she then suddenly returned with a
harmless, indeed quite a happy, memento. “Was
I <em>very</em> grotesque?”</p>

<p>He demurred. “Grotesque?”</p>

<p>“I mean&mdash;<em>did</em> I go on about it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore would have no general descriptions;
he was specific, he was vivid. “You
banged the desk. You raved. You shrieked.”</p>

<p>This was a note she appeared indulgently,
almost tenderly, to recognise. “We <em>do</em> shriek
at Missoura Top!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you do at Missoura Top,
but I know what you did at Covering End!”</p>

<p>She warmed at last to his tone. “So do <em>I</em>
then! I surprised you. You weren’t at all
prepared<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He took her briskly up. “No&mdash;and I’m not
prepared yet!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew could quite see it. “Yes,
you’re too astonished.”</p>

<p>“My astonishment’s my own affair,” he retorted&mdash;“not
less so than my memory!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_368" title="368"> </a>“Oh, I yield to your memory,” said the charming
woman, “and I confess my extravagance.
But quite, you know, <em>as</em> extravagance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t at all know,”&mdash;Mr. Prodmore shook
it off,&mdash;“nor what you <em>call</em> extravagance.”</p>

<p>“Why, banging the desk. Raving. Shrieking.
I over-did it,” she exclaimed; “I wanted
to please you!”</p>

<p>She had too happy a beauty, as she sat in her
high-backed chair, to have been condemned to
say that to any man without a certain effect.
The effect on Mr. Prodmore was striking. “So
you said,” he sternly inquired, “what you didn’t
believe?”</p>

<p>She flushed with the avowal. “Yes&mdash;for you.”</p>

<p>He looked at her hard. “For <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>Under his eye&mdash;for her flush continued&mdash;she
slowly got up. “And for those good people.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”&mdash;he sounded most sarcastic. “Should
you like me to call them back?”</p>

<p>“No.” She was still gay enough, but very
decided. “I took them in.”</p>

<p>“And now you want to take <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Prodmore!” she almost pitifully,
but not quite adequately, moaned.</p>

<p>He appeared to feel he had gone a little far.
“Well, if we’re not what you say<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_369" title="369"> </a>“Yes?”&mdash;she looked up askance at the stroke.</p>

<p>“Why the devil do you want us?” The question
rang out and was truly for the poor lady, as
the quick suffusion of her eyes showed, a challenge
it would take more time than he left her
properly to pick up. He left her in fact no time
at all before he went on: “Why the devil did
you say you’d offer fifty?”</p>

<p>She looked quite wan and seemed to wonder.
“<em>Did</em> I say that?” She could only let his
challenge lie. “It was a figure of speech!”</p>

<p>“Then that’s the kind of figure we’re talking
about!” Mr. Prodmore’s sharpness would have
struck an auditor as the more effective that, on
the heels of this thrust, seeing the ancient butler
reappear, he dropped the victim of it as
comparatively unimportant and directed his
fierceness instantly to Chivers, who mildly
gaped at him from the threshold of the court.
“Have you seen Miss Prodmore? If you
haven’t, find her!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew addressed their visitor in a
very different tone, though with the full authority
of her benevolence. “You won’t, my dear
man.” To Mr. Prodmore also she continued
bland. “I happen to know she has gone for a
walk.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_370" title="370"> </a>“A walk&mdash;alone?” Mr. Prodmore gasped.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not alone.” Mrs. Gracedew looked
at Chivers with a vague smile of appeal for
help, but he could only give her, from under
his bent old brow, the blank decency of his
wonder. It seemed to make her feel afresh
that she was, after all, alone&mdash;so that in her
loneliness, which had also its fine sad charm,
she risked another brush with their formidable
friend. “Cora has gone with Mr. Pegg.”</p>

<p>“Pegg has <em>been</em> here?”</p>

<p>It was like a splash in a full basin, but she
launched the whole craft. “He walked with
her from the station.”</p>

<p>“When she arrived?” Mr. Prodmore rose
like outraged Neptune. “That’s why she was
so late?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew assented. “Why I got here
first. I get everywhere first!” she bravely
laughed.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore looked round him in purple
dismay&mdash;it was so clearly a question for him
where <em>he</em> should get, and what! “In which
direction did they go?” he imperiously asked.</p>

<p>His rudeness was too evident to be more
than lightly recognised. “I think I must let
you ascertain for yourself!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_371" title="371"> </a>All he could do then was to shout it to
Chivers. “Call my carriage, you ass!” After
which, as the old man melted into the vestibule,
he dashed about blindly for his hat, pounced
upon it and seemed, furious but helpless, on
the point of hurling it at his contradictress as
a gage of battle. “So you abetted and protected
this wicked, low intrigue?”</p>

<p>She had something in her face now that was
indifferent to any violence. “You’re too disappointed
to see your real interest: oughtn’t I
therefore in common charity to point it out to
you?”</p>

<p>He faced her question so far as to treat it as
one. “What do <em>you</em> know of my disappointment?”</p>

<p>There was something in his very harshness
that even helped her, for it added at this
moment to her sense of making out in his
narrowed glare a couple of tears of rage. “I
know everything.”</p>

<p>“What do you know of my real interest?”
he went on as if he had not heard her.</p>

<p>“I know enough for my purpose&mdash;which is
to offer you a handsome condition. I think it’s
not I who have protected the happy understanding
that you call by so ugly a name; it’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_372" title="372"> </a>
the happy understanding that has put me”&mdash;she
gained confidence&mdash;“well, in a position.
Do drive after them, if you like&mdash;but catch
up with them only to forgive them. If you’ll
do that, I’ll pay your price.”</p>

<p>The particular air with which, a minute after
Mrs. Gracedew had spoken these words, Mr.
Prodmore achieved a transfer of his attention
to the inside of his hat&mdash;this special shade of
majesty would have taxed the descriptive resources
of the most accomplished reporter. It
is none the less certain that he appeared for
some time absorbed in that receptacle&mdash;appeared
at last to breathe into it hard. “What do you
call my price?”</p>

<p>“Why, the sum you just mentioned&mdash;fifty
thousand!” Mrs. Gracedew feverishly quavered.</p>

<p>He looked at her as if stupefied. “<em>That’s</em> not
my price&mdash;and it never for a moment was!”
If derision can be dry, Mr. Prodmore’s was of
the driest. “Besides,” he rang out, “my price
is up!”</p>

<p>She caught it with a long wail. “Up?”</p>

<p>Oh, he let her have it now! “Seventy thousand.”</p>

<p>She turned away overwhelmed, but still with
voice for her despair. “Oh, deary me!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_373" title="373"> </a>Mr. Prodmore was already at the door, from
which he launched his ultimatum. “It’s to take
or to leave!”</p>

<p>She would have had to leave it, perhaps, had
not something happened at this moment to nerve
her for the effort of staying him with a quick
motion. Captain Yule had come into sight on
the staircase and, after just faltering at what
he himself saw, had marched resolutely enough
down. She watched him arrive&mdash;watched him
with an attention that visibly and responsively
excited his own; after which she passed nearer
to their companion. “Seventy thousand, then!”&mdash;it
gleamed between them, in her muffled hiss,
as if she had planted a dagger.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodmore, to do him justice, took his
wound in front. “Seventy thousand&mdash;done!”
And, without another look at Yule, he was presently
heard to bang the outer door after him
for a sign.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_374" title="374"> </a>VIII</h3>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> young man, meanwhile, had approached in
surprise. “He’s gone? I’ve been looking for
him!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew was out of breath; there was
a disturbed whiteness of bosom in her which
needed time to subside and which she might
have appeared to retreat before him on purpose
to veil. “I don’t think, you know, that you
need him&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>Clement Yule was mystified. “Now?”</p>

<p>She recovered herself enough to explain&mdash;made
an effort at least to be plausible. “I mean that&mdash;if
you don’t mind&mdash;you must deal with <em>me</em>.
I’ve arranged with Mr. Prodmore to take it
over.”</p>

<p>Oh, he gave her no help! “Take what over?”</p>

<p>She looked all about as if not quite thinking
what it could be called; at last, however, she
offered with a smile a sort of substitute for a
name. “Why, your debt.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_375" title="375"> </a>But he was only the more bewildered. “<em>Can</em>
you&mdash;without arranging with <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>She turned it round, but as if merely to oblige
him. “That’s precisely what I want to do.”
Then, more brightly, as she thought further:
“That is, I mean, I want you to arrange with
<em>me</em>. Surely you will,” she said encouragingly.</p>

<p>His own processes, in spite of a marked earnestness,
were much less rapid. “But if I arrange
with anybody<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes?” She cheerfully waited.</p>

<p>“How do I perform my engagement?”</p>

<p>“The one to Mr. Prodmore?”</p>

<p>He looked surprised at her speaking as if he
had half-a-dozen. “Yes&mdash;that’s the worst.”</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;the worst!” And she gave a
happy laugh that made him stare.</p>

<p>He broke into quite a different one. “You
speak as if its being the worst made it the best!”</p>

<p>“It does&mdash;for me. You don’t,” said Mrs.
Gracedew, “perform any engagement.”</p>

<p>He required a moment to take it in; then
something extraordinary leaped into his face.
“He lets me off?”</p>

<p>Ah, she could ring out now! “He lets you
off.”</p>

<p>It lifted him high, but only to drop him with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_376" title="376"> </a>
an audible thud. “Oh, I see&mdash;I lose my
house!”</p>

<p>“Dear, no&mdash;<em>that</em> doesn’t follow!” She spoke
as if the absurdity he indicated were the last conceivable,
but there was a certain want of sharpness
of edge in her expression of the alternative.
“You arrange with <em>me</em> to keep it.”</p>

<p>There was quite a corresponding want, clearly,
in the image presented to the Captain&mdash;of which,
for a moment, he seemed with difficulty to follow
the contour. “How do I arrange?”</p>

<p>“Well, we must think,” said Mrs. Gracedew;
“we must wait.” She spoke as if this were a
detail for which she had not yet had much attention;
only bringing out, however, the next instant
in an encouraging cry and as if it were
by itself almost a solution: “We must find some
way!” She might have been talking to a reasonable
child.</p>

<p>But even reasonable children ask too many
questions. “Yes&mdash;and what way <em>can</em> we find?”
Clement Yule, glancing about him, was so struck
with the absence of ways that he appeared to
remember with something of regret how different
it had been before. “With Prodmore it was
simple enough. You see I could marry his
daughter.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_377" title="377"> </a>Mrs. Gracedew was silent just long enough for
her soft ironic smile to fill the cup of the pause.
“<em>Could</em> you?”</p>

<p>It was as if he had tasted in the words the
wine at the brim; for he gave, under the effect
of them, a sudden headshake and an awkward
laugh. “Well, never perhaps <em>that</em> exactly&mdash;when
it came to the point. But I had to, you
see<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” It was difficult to say just what.</p>

<p>She took advantage of it, looking hard, but
not seeing at all. “You had to<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he repeated ruefully, “think a lot
about it. You didn’t suspect that?”</p>

<p>Oh, if he came to suspicions she could only
break off! “Don’t ask me too many questions.”</p>

<p>He looked an instant as if he wondered why.
“But isn’t this just the moment for them?”
He fronted her, with a quickness he tried to
dissimulate, from the other side. “What <em>did</em>
you suppose?”</p>

<p>She looked everywhere but into his face.
“Why, I supposed you were in distress.”</p>

<p>He was very grave. “About his terms?”</p>

<p>“About his terms of course!” she laughed.
“Not about his religious opinions.”</p>

<p>His gratitude was too great for gaiety. “You
really, in your beautiful sympathy, <em>guessed</em> my
fix?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_378" title="378"> </a>But she declined to be too solemn. “Dear
Captain Yule, it all quite stuck out of you!”</p>

<p>“You mean I floundered like a drowning
man<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>Well, she consented to have meant that. “Till
I plunged in!”</p>

<p>He appeared there for a few seconds, to see
her again take the jump and to listen again to
the splash; then, with an odd, sharp impulse,
he turned his back. “You saved me.”</p>

<p>She wouldn’t deny it&mdash;on the contrary.
“What a pity, now, <em>I</em> haven’t a daughter!”</p>

<p>On this he slowly came round again. “What
should I do with her?”</p>

<p>“You’d treat her, I hope, better than you’ve
treated Miss Prodmore.”</p>

<p>The young man positively coloured. “But
I haven’t been bad<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>The sight of this effect of her small joke
produced on Mrs. Gracedew’s part an emotion
less controllable than any she had yet felt.
“Oh, you delightful goose!” she irrepressibly
dropped.</p>

<p>She made his blush deepen, but the aggravation
was a relief. “Of course&mdash;I’m all right,
and there’s only one pity in the matter. I’ve
nothing&mdash;nothing whatever, not a scrap of service
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_379" title="379"> </a>
nor a thing you’d care for&mdash;to offer you in
compensation.”</p>

<p>She looked at him ever so kindly. “I’m not,
as they say, ‘on the make.’” Never had he
been put right with a lighter hand. “I didn’t
do it for payment.”</p>

<p>“Then what did you do it for?”</p>

<p>For something, it might have seemed, as her
eyes dropped and strayed, that had got brushed
into a crevice of the old pavement. “Because
I hated Mr. Prodmore.”</p>

<p>He conscientiously demurred. “So much as
all that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” she replied impatiently, “of
course you also know how much I like the
house. My hates and my likes,” she subtly
explained, “can never live together. I get one
of them out. The one this time was that man.”</p>

<p>He showed a candour of interest. “Yes&mdash;you
got him out. Yes&mdash;I saw him go.” And
his inner vision appeared to attend for some
moments Mr. Prodmore’s departure. “But how
did you do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Women<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” Mrs.
Gracedew but vaguely sketched it.</p>

<p>A touch or two, however, for that subject,
could of course almost always suffice. “Precisely&mdash;women.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_380" title="380"> </a>
May I smoke again?” Clement
Yule abruptly asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly. But I managed Mr. Prodmore,”
she laughed as he re-lighted, “without cigarettes.”</p>

<p>Her companion puffed. “<em>I</em> couldn’t manage
him.”</p>

<p>“So I saw!”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> couldn’t get him out.”</p>

<p>“So <em>he</em> saw!”</p>

<p>Captain Yule, for a little, lost himself in his
smoke. “Where is he gone?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea. But I meet him
again,” she hastened to add&mdash;“very soon.”</p>

<p>“And when do you meet <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“Why, whenever you’ll come to see me.”
For the twentieth time she gathered herself as
if the words she had just spoken were quite
her last hand. “At present, you see, I <em>have</em> a
train to catch.”</p>

<p>Absorbed in the trivial act that engaged him,
he gave her no help. “A train?”</p>

<p>“Surely. I didn’t walk.”</p>

<p>“No; but even trains<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” His eyes clung
to her now. “You fly?”</p>

<p>“I try to. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>He had got between her and the door of departure
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_381" title="381"> </a>
quite as, on her attempt to quit him
half an hour before, he had anticipated her
approach to the stairs; and in this position he
took no notice of her farewell. “I said just
now that I had nothing to offer you. But of
course I’ve the house itself.”</p>

<p>“The house?” She stared. “Why, I’ve <em>got</em>
it?”</p>

<p>“Got it?”</p>

<p>“All in my head, I mean. That’s all I
want.” She had not yet, save to Mr. Prodmore,
made quite so light of it.</p>

<p>This had its action in his markedly longer
face. “Why, I thought you loved it so!”</p>

<p>Ah, she was perfectly consistent. “I love it
far too much to deprive <em>you</em> of it.”</p>

<p>Yet Clement Yule could in a fashion meet
her. “Oh, it wouldn’t be depriving<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>She altogether protested. “Not to turn you
out<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“Dear lady, I’ve never been <em>in</em>!”</p>

<p>Oh, she was none the less downright.
“You’re in <em>now</em>&mdash;I’ve put you, and you must
stay.” He looked round so woefully, however,
that she presently attenuated. “I don’t mean
<em>all</em> the while, but long enough<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>“Long enough for what?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_382" title="382"> </a>“For me to feel you’re here.”</p>

<p>“And how long will that take?”</p>

<p>“Well, you think me very fast&mdash;but sometimes
I’m slow. I told you just now, at any
rate,” she went on, “that I had arranged you
should lose nothing. Is the very next thing I
do, then, to make you lose everything?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a question of what I lose,” the
young man anxiously cried; “it’s a question of
what I <em>do</em>! What <em>have</em> I done to find it all
so plain?” Fate was really&mdash;fate reversed,
improved, and unnatural&mdash;too much for him,
and his heated young face showed honest stupefaction.
“I haven’t lifted a finger. It’s you
who have done all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if you’re just where you were
before, how in the world are you saved?” She
put it to him with still superior lucidity.</p>

<p>“By my life’s being my own again&mdash;to do
what I want.”</p>

<p>“What you ‘want’”&mdash;Mrs. Gracedew’s handsome
uplifted head had it all there, every inch
of it&mdash;“is to keep your house.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but only,” he perfectly assented, “if,
as you said, you find a way!”</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> found a way&mdash;and there the way is:
for <em>me</em> just simply not to touch the place.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_383" title="383"> </a>
What you ‘want,’” she argued more closely,
“is what made you give in to Prodmore. What
you ‘want’ is these walls and these acres.
What you ‘want’ is to take the way I first
showed you.”</p>

<p>Her companion’s eyes, quitting for the purpose
her face, looked to the quarter marked by
her last words as at an horizon now remote.
“Why, the way you first showed me was to
marry Cora!”</p>

<p>She had to admit it, but as little as possible.
“Practically&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just ‘practically’ that I can’t!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that then,” said Mrs. Gracedew.
“You didn’t tell me.”</p>

<p>He passed, with an approach to a grimace,
his hand over the back of his head. “I felt
a delicacy!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t even know <em>that</em>.” She spoke it
almost sadly.</p>

<p>“It didn’t strike you that I might?”</p>

<p>She thought a moment. “No.” She thought
again. “No. But don’t quarrel with me about
it <em>now</em>!”</p>

<p>“Quarrel with you?” he looked amazement.</p>

<p>She laughed, but she had changed colour. “Cora,
at any rate, felt no delicacy. Cora told me.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_384" title="384"> </a>Clement Yule fairly gaped. “Then she did
know<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“She knew all; and if her father said she
didn’t, he simply told you what was not.” She
frankly gave him this, but the next minute, as
if she had startled him more than she meant,
she jumped to reassurance. “It was quite right
of her. She would have refused you.”</p>

<p>The young man stared. “Oh!” He was
quick, however, to show&mdash;by an amusement
perhaps a trifle over-done&mdash;that he felt no personal
wound. “Do you call that quite right?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gracedew looked at it again. “For <em>her</em>&mdash;yes;
and for Prodmore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for Prodmore”&mdash;his laugh grew more
grim&mdash;“with all my heart!”</p>

<p>This, then,&mdash;her kind eyes seemed to drop it
upon him,&mdash;was all she meant. “To stay at your
post&mdash;<em>that</em> was the way I showed you.”</p>

<p>He had come round to it now, as mechanically,
in intenser thought, he smoothed down the thick
hair he had rubbed up; but his face soon enough
gave out, in wonder and pain, that his freedom
was somehow only a new predicament. “How
can I take any way at all, dear lady<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>“If I only stick here in your path?” She had
taken him straight up, and with spirit; and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_385" title="385"> </a>
same spirit bore her to the end. “I won’t stick
a moment more! Haven’t I been trying this age
to leave you?”</p>

<p>Clement Yule, for all answer, caught her sharply,
in her passage, by the arm. “You surrender your
rights?” He was for an instant almost terrible.</p>

<p>She quite turned pale with it. “Weren’t you
ready to surrender <em>yours</em>?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t any, so it was deuced easy. I hadn’t
paid for them.”</p>

<p>Oh that, she let him see,&mdash;even though with
his continued grasp he might hurt her,&mdash;had
nothing in it! “Your ancestors had paid: it’s
the same thing.” Erect there in the brightness of
her triumph and the force of her logic, she must
yet, to anticipate his return, take a stride&mdash;like
a sudden dip into a gully and the scramble up on
the other bank&mdash;that put her dignity to the test.
“You’re just, in a manner, my tenant.”</p>

<p>“But how can I treat that as such a mere detail?
I’m your tenant on what terms?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>any</em> terms&mdash;choose them for yourself!”
She made an attempt to free her arm&mdash;gave it a
small vain shake. Then, as if to bribe him to
let her go: “You can write me about them.”</p>

<p>He appeared to consider it. “To Missoura
Top?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_386" title="386"> </a>She fully assented. “I go right back.” As if
it had put him off his guard she broke away.
“Farewell!”</p>

<p>She broke away, but he broke faster, and once
more, nearer the door, he had barred her escape.
“Just one little moment, please. If you won’t
tell me your own terms, you must at least tell me
Prodmore’s.”</p>

<p>Ah, the fiend&mdash;she could never squeeze past
<em>that</em>! All she could do, for the instant, was to
reverberate foolishly “Prodmore’s?”</p>

<p>But there was nothing foolish, at last, about <em>him</em>.
“How you did it&mdash;how you managed him.”
His feet were firm while he waited, though he
had to wait some time. “You bought him out?”</p>

<p>She made less of it than, clearly, he had ever
heard made of a stroke of business; it might have
been a case of his owing her ninepence. “I
bought him out.”</p>

<p>He wanted at least the exact sum. “For how
much?” Her silence seemed to say that she had
made no note of it, but his pressure only increased.
“I really must know.”</p>

<p>She continued to try to treat it as if she had
merely paid for his cab&mdash;she put even what
she could of that suggestion into a tender, helpless,
obstinate headshake. “You shall never
know!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_387" title="387"> </a>The only thing his own manner met was the
obstinacy. “I’ll get it from <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>She repeated her headshake, but with a world
of sadness added, “Get it if you can!”</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes now as if it was
the sadness that struck him most. “He won’t
say, because he <em>did</em> you?”</p>

<p>They showed each other, on this, the least
separated faces yet. “He’ll never, never say.”</p>

<p>The confidence in it was so tender that it
sounded almost like pity, and the young man
took it up with all the flush of the sense that
pity could be but for <em>him</em>. This sense broke
full in her face. “The scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” she returned, with equal passion&mdash;“I
was only too clever for him!” The
thought of it was again an exaltation in which
she pushed her friend aside. “So let me go!”</p>

<p>The push was like a jar that made the vessel
overflow, and he was before her now as if he
stretched across the hall. “With the heroic
view of your power and the barren beauty of
your sacrifice? You pour out money, you move
a mountain, and to let you ‘go,’ to close the
door fast behind you, is all I can figure out
to do for you?” His emotion trembled out of
him with the stammer of a new language, but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_388" title="388"> </a>
it was as if in a minute or two he had thrown
over all consciousness. “You’re the most generous&mdash;you’re
the noblest of women! The
wonderful chance that brought you here<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!”</p>

<p>His own arm was grasped now&mdash;she knew
better than he about the wonderful chance. “It
brought <em>you</em> at the same happy hour! I’ve
done what I liked,” she went on very simply;
“and the only way to thank me is to believe it.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done it for a proud, poor man”&mdash;his
answer was quite as direct. “He has nothing&mdash;in
the light of such a magic as yours&mdash;either
to give or to hope; but you’ve made him, in
a little miraculous hour, think of you<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He stumbled with the rush of things, and
if silence can, in its way, be active, there was
a collapse too, for an instant, on her closed lips.
These lips, however, she at last opened. “How
have I made him think of me?”</p>

<p>“As he has thought of no other woman!”
He had personal possession of her now, and it
broke, as he pressed her, as he pleaded, the helpless
fall of his eloquence. “Mrs. Gracedew&mdash;don’t
leave me.” He jerked his head passionately
at the whole place and the yellow afternoon.
“If you made me care<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“It was surely that you had made <em>me</em> first!”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_389" title="389"> </a>
She laughed, and her laugh disengaged her, so
that before he could reply she had again put
space between them.</p>

<p>He accepted the space now&mdash;he appeared so
sure of his point. “Then let me go on caring.
When I asked you awhile back for some possible
adjustment to my new source of credit,
you simply put off the question&mdash;told me I
must trust to time for it. Well,” said Clement
Yule, “I’ve trusted to time so effectually that
ten little minutes have made me find it. I’ve
found it because I’ve so quickly found <em>you</em>. May
I, Mrs. Gracedew, keep <em>all</em> that I’ve found? I
offer you in return the only thing I have to give&mdash;I
offer you my hand and my life.”</p>

<p>She held him off, across the hall, for a time
almost out of proportion to the previous wait
he had just made so little of. Then at last also,
when she answered, it might have passed for a
plea for further postponement, even for a plea
for mercy. “Ah, Captain Yule<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>!” But she
turned suddenly off: the flower had been nipped
in the bud by the re-entrance of Chivers, at whom
his master veritably glowered.</p>

<p>“What the devil is it?”</p>

<p>The old man showed the shock, but he had his
duty. “Another party.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_390" title="390"> </a>Mrs. Gracedew, at this, wheeled round. “The
‘party up’!” It brought back her voice&mdash;indeed,
all her gaiety. And her gaiety was always
determinant. “Show them in.”</p>

<p>Clement Yule’s face fell while Chivers proceeded
to obey. “You’ll <em>have</em> them?” he wailed
across the hall.</p>

<p>“Ah! mayn’t I be proud of my house?” she
tossed back at him.</p>

<p>At this, radiant, he had rushed at her. “Then
you accept<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?”</p>

<p>Her raised hand checked him. “Hush!”</p>

<p>He fell back&mdash;the party was there. Chivers
ushered it as he had ushered the other, making
the most, this time, of more scanty material&mdash;four
persons so spectacled, satchelled, shawled,
and handbooked that they testified on the spot
to a particular foreign origin and presented
themselves indeed very much as tourists who,
at an hotel, casting up the promise of comfort
or the portent of cost, take possession, while
they wait for their keys, with expert looks and
free sounds. Clement Yule, who had receded,
effacing himself, to the quarter opposed to that
of his companion, addressed to their visitors a
covert but dismayed stare and then, edging
round, in his agitation, to the rear, instinctively
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_391" title="391"> </a>
sought relief by escape through the open passage.
One of the invaders meanwhile&mdash;a broad-faced
gentleman with long hair tucked behind
his ears and a ring on each forefinger&mdash;had
lost no time in showing he knew where to
begin. He began at the top&mdash;the proper place,
and took in the dark pictures ranged above the
tapestry. “Olt vamily bortraits?”&mdash;he appealed
to Chivers and spoke very loud.</p>

<p>Chivers rose to the occasion and, gracefully pawing
the air, began also at the beginning. “Dame
Dorothy Yule&mdash;who lived to a hundred and one.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and one&mdash;ach <em>so</em>!” broke, with
a resigned absence of criticism, from each of
the interested group; another member of which,
however, indicated with a somewhat fatigued
skip the central figure of the series, the personage
with the long white legs that Mrs. Gracedew
had invited the previous inquirers to remark.
“Who’s dis?” the present inquirer asked.</p>

<p>The question affected the lovely lady over by
the fireplace as the trumpet of battle affects a
generous steed. She flashed on the instant into
the middle of the hall and into the friendliest
and most familiar relation with everyone and
with everything. “John Anthony Yule, sir,&mdash;who
passed away, poor duck, in his flower!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_392" title="392"> </a>They met her with low salutations, a sweep of
ugly shawls, and a brush of queer German hats:
she had issued, to their glazed convergence, from
the dusk of the Middle Ages and the shade of
high pieces, and now stood there, beautiful and
human and happy, in a light that, whatever it
was for themselves, the very breadth of their
attention, the expression of their serious faces,
converted straightway for her into a new, and
oh! into the right, one. To a detached observer
of the whole it would have been promptly clear
that she found herself striking these good people
very much as the lawful heir had, half an hour
before, struck another stranger&mdash;that she produced
in them, in her setting of assured antiquity,
quite the romantic vibration that she had responded
to in the presence of that personage.
They read her as she read <em>him</em>, and a bright and
deepening cheer, reflected dimly in their thick
thoroughness, went out from her as she accepted
their reading. An impression was exchanged,
for the minute, from side to side&mdash;their grave
admiration of the finest feature of the curious
house and the deep free radiance of her silent,
grateful “Why not?” It made a passage of
some intensity and some duration, of which the
effect, indeed, the next minute, was to cause the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_393" title="393"> </a>
only lady of the party&mdash;a matron of rich Jewish
type, with small nippers on a huge nose and a
face out of proportion to her little Freischütz hat&mdash;to
break the spell by an uneasy turn and a stray
glance at one of the other pictures. “Who’s <em>dat</em>?”</p>

<p>“That?” The picture chanced to be a portrait
over the wide arch, and something happened,
at the very moment, to arrest Mrs. Gracedew’s
eyes rather above than below. What took place,
in a word, was that Clement Yule, already fidgeting
in his impatience back from the front, just
occupied the arch, completed her thought, and
filled her vision. “Oh, that’s my future husband!”
He caught the words, but answered
them only by a long look at her as he moved,
with a checked wildness of which she alone, of
all the spectators, had a sense, straight across the
hall again and to the other opening. He paused
there as he had done before, then with a last
dumb appeal to her dropped into the court and
passed into the garden. Mrs. Gracedew, already
so wonderful to their visitors, was, before she
followed him, wonderful with a greater wonder
to poor Chivers. “You dear old thing&mdash;I give
it all back to you!”</p>

<h2>WORKS BY HENRY JAMES.</h2>

<p class="center big">EMBARRASSMENTS.</p>

<p class="center">12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>“Mr. Henry James has produced no more clever and subtle work than is to be found
in his latest volume.... There are in these tales passages of splendid realism. The
portrait of Geoffrey Dowling is a masterpiece of characterization. And there are sentences,
unobtrusive asides, which flash with the brilliancy of true wit.”&mdash;<cite>New York
Tribune.</cite></p>

<p>“Mr. James’s writings are distinctively works of art. One and all of them appeal
most strongly to cultivated minds. In no instance does he descend from his transcendent
ideals of literature. An acquaintance with Henry James means an appreciation of the
finer style of written English, and an inhalation of the atmosphere of purest English
literature. No list of books for the summer will be complete without ‘<b>Embarrassments</b>.’”&mdash;<cite>Cambridge
Press.</cite></p>

<p class="center space-above big">THE OTHER HOUSE.</p>

<p class="center">12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>“The characters are original and well drawn. The incidents are natural and clearly
described. The dialogues are crisp and to the point. Neither of ‘padding’ nor a vulgar
sensationalism is there any trace. A most meritorious work, then, and one which can
hardly fail to add to the author’s reputation.”&mdash;<cite>New York Herald.</cite></p>

<p>“‘The Other House’ shows Henry James at his best. That best is a putting into
words of an exquisite comprehension of motives and shades of thought, a magic grasp of
character variations, a bringing to the surface of hidden nerve fibres ever unsuspected
yet tremendously potent.”&mdash;<cite>Chicago Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class="center space-above big">THE PRINCESS CASAMASSIMA.</p>

<p class="center">12mo, $1.25.</p>

<p>We find no fault with Mr. Henry James’s “Princess Casamassima.” It is a great
novel; it is his greatest, and it is incomparably the greatest novel of the year in our language....
From first to last we find no weakness in the book; the drama works simply
and naturally; the causes and effects are logically related; the theme is made literature
without ceasing to be life.&mdash;<cite>Harper’s New Monthly Magazine, Editor’s Study.</cite></p>

<p class="center space-above big">THE REVERBERATOR.</p>

<p class="center">12mo, $1.00.</p>

<p>The public will be glad to find Mr. James in his best vein. One is thankful again
that there is so brilliant an American author to give us entertaining sketches of life.&mdash;<cite>Boston
Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="center space-above big">THE ASPERN PAPERS,<br/><small>AND OTHER STORIES.</small></p>

<p class="center">12mo, $1.00.</p>

<p>The stories are told with that mastery of the art of story-telling which their writer
possesses in a conspicuous degree.&mdash;<cite>Literary World.</cite></p>

<p>It is as a short story writer that we think Mr. James appears at his best, and in this
volume he may be read in his most attractive and most artistic vein.&mdash;<cite>Boston Saturday
Evening Gazette.</cite></p>

<p>Mr. Henry James is at his best in “The Aspern Papers.” ... For careful finish,
minute analysis, and vivid description of both the scenes and the characters, “The
Aspern Papers” may take high rank among Mr. James’s stories.&mdash;<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class="center space-above big">PARTIAL PORTRAITS.</p>

<p class="center">12mo, $1.75.</p>

<p>Henry James has never appeared to better advantage as an author than in this
delightful volume of critical essays.... No one can fail to acknowledge the exquisite
charm of style which pervades the book, and the kind appreciation the author evinces of
the finer and subtler qualities of the authors with whom he deals.&mdash;<cite>Boston Saturday
Evening Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class="center space-above big">THE BOSTONIANS.</p>

<p class="center">12mo, $1.25.</p>

<p>Unquestionably “The Bostonians” is not only the most brilliant and remarkable of
Mr. James’s novels, but it is one of the most important of recent contributions to literature.&mdash;<cite>Boston

<p class="center space-above big">A LONDON LIFE,<br/><small>AND OTHER STORIES.</small></p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
